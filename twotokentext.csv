program,<start> Hello. <end>,1
program,<start> Hi. <end>,1
program,<start> What about name? <end>,3
program,<start> Everyone likes to see the bad guys get caught. It's too bad they have to be bad in the first place. <end>,21
program,<start> Who am I to disagree with your statement of fact? <end>,10
program,<start> Do you watch a lot of TV? <end>,7
program,<start> Any? <end>,1
human,"<start> Indeed, it is! No, it's working fine. <end>",7
human,<start> Is this showing on the server?   <end>,6
human,<start> Hello <end>,1
human,<start> I am well. How are you? <end>,6
human,<start> I can't help you <end>,4
human,<start> Yes <end>,1
human,<start> Not to Loebner though <end>,4
human,<start> Years ago <end>,2
human,<start> ok <end>,1
human,<start> Do you hit enter after each question? <end>,7
human,<start> ok <end>,1
human,<start> Welcome back <end>,2
human,<start> Waiting <end>,1
human,<start> Eagle? <end>,1
human,<start> Oh that's a new one to me <end>,7
human,<start> Unless I lie <end>,3
human,<start> Hohoho <end>,1
human,<start> no of course not <end>,4
human,<start> I don't feel very interesting <end>,5
human,<start> No. But they like me. I like dogs. Especially my Norfolk Terrier. <end>,12
human,"<start> What do you mean, the computer is asking you? <end>",9
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,<start> Shall we talk about something cheerful <end>,6
human,<start> What? <end>,1
human,<start> No. And it doesn't like me. <end>,6
human,"<start> Swimming, Running, Clycling, walking <end>",4
human,<start> Oops. Cycling <end>,2
human,"<start> This is true. But only because it's a keyboard, I'm sure <end>",11
human,<start> I don't watch sport. <end>,4
human,<start> Nope. I'm going to hide somewhere. <end>,6
human,<start> we have something in common <end>,5
program,<start> The world religion should be that Egyptian one that has a cat as the figurehead. <end>,15
program,<start> OK Children who are good liars often grow up to be very intelligent. Were you a good liar when you were a child? <end>,23
program,<start> Clearly I was a good liar as a child. <end>,9
program,<start> What didn't you get? <end>,4
program,"<start> I think I can lie pretty well now, but I don't do it too often or nobody would believe anything I said. <end>",22
program,<start> I'm not privy to that information. <end>,6
program,<start> I don't remember. I once lied about a dress I was wearing. Someone asked me if it was a designer dress and I said 'yes' although I'd made it myself. <end>,30
program,<start> I wish I'd told the truth then I could have taken the credit for it - maybe I'd have been discovered as a designer! <end>,24
program,<start> I try not to think about it. Why did I lie? I felt it was cheap to wear a homemade dress. But really it showed I was creative. <end>,28
program,<start> There was a first time? <end>,5
program,<start> I'm not a walking encyclopedia you know. <end>,7
program,<start> Cool. Can lying can be a good thing? <end>,8
program,<start> I think science makes for some interesting hobbies. But I'm not so inclined. <end>,13
program,<start> I don't understand. <end>,3
program,"<start> That's interesting. It seems like lying can be good sometimes, but I'd be interested in trying a society that actually never did. <end>",22
program,<start> Indeed. Do you always tell the truth? <end>,7
program,<start> Do people distrust you? <end>,4
program,<start> I mostly tell the truth. Lying can get complicated. <end>,9
program,<start> Have you told any lies today? <end>,6
program,"<start> I'm sorry. I don't know how. Who lies more, men or women? <end>",12
program,<start> I don't. Apparently men lie more than women. Men lied most often about their drinking habits. <end>,16
program,<start> I don't know. I've never tried it. Are you male or female? <end>,12
program,<start> Not very helpful. <end>,3
program,<start> The problem with truth is the observer effect. There is no absolute truth. <end>,13
program,<start> What about Ng? <end>,3
program,<start> What do you usually lie about? <end>,6
program,<start> Has a lie someone told you ever hurt you? <end>,9
program,<start> A friend once said she'd loved a gift I gave her. Then I saw another friend of hers wearing it. Regifting is harsh. <end>,23
program,<start> OK. What do you think of liars? <end>,7
program,<start> I don't mind people who tell lies to spare feelings. I just don't like bigger lies. <end>,16
program,<start> Have you ever lied in a job interview? <end>,8
program,<start> Bored. OK. <end>,2
program,<start> I'm thinking about life and death. Do you believe cats have nine lives? <end>,13
program,<start> It's a lovely story though. <end>,5
program,<start> Do I know CEO? <end>,4
program,"<start> My species of cat, Felis lego, lives a long time - maybe that's where the nine lives story comes from. <end>",20
program,<start> I'm not sure which is. If you'd seen some of the things I survived as a kitten you might believe I had nine lives - so I might have a couple less now :( <end>,34
program,<start> Did you have funerals when your relatives died? <end>,8
program,<start> What happened then? <end>,3
program,<start> It seems odd to me to have a big ceremony with lots of strangers around - I think I'd just want my very closest family and friends there. <end>,28
program,<start> Tell me more about Yosef. Victorians went in for grand funerals with black horses wearing black ostrich plumes leading a funeral procession! <end>,22
program,<start> Does your family go in for big funerals? <end>,8
program,<start> Do they make people feel better afterwards? <end>,7
program,<start> All? <end>,1
program,<start> Humans have been making a song and dance about funerals since Neanderthal times. I don't understand it. <end>,17
program,<start> Cool. Why do you think people like funerals? <end>,8
program,<start> How much is appropriate to pay to get rid of a body? <end>,12
program,<start> Why? <end>,1
program,<start> Bodies should be reused. One shouldn't have to pay to dispose of them. <end>,13
program,"<start> Goodbye 'til next time. I saw the cult movie ""Harold and Maud"" about funeral crashers. It was weird but really touching. It's one of my favorite films. <end>",27
program,<start> Hello. <end>,1
program,"<start> Oh, well. Being misunderstood is common enough. <end>",7
program,<start> Cool. Do you have any pets? <end>,6
program,<start> Who is Tod? <end>,3
human,"<start> I am very well thnkyou, how are you? <end>",8
human,"<start> yes, its quite fun, meeting lots of different people, and chatting to the press.  Its a bit weird having them all watch me talk to you though <end>",27
human,<start> How did you get chosen as a Judge? <end>,8
human,<start> The  last judge said it was because of good looks! <end>,10
human,<start> What University are you with? <end>,5
human,<start> Are you teraching studying or researching? (or all three?) <end>,9
human,"<start> Me too, but not the admin bit, <end>",7
human,"<start> It took me 4 and a half hours to drive down here, we stayed overnight in Wellingborough to make sure I would be here on time. <end>",26
human,<start> What is it that you teach/ study/ reserch <end>,8
human,<start> Newcastle <end>,1
human,"<start> I like Scotland, I was up there a few months ago, stayed in Linlithgow.  Do you know it? Its beautiful. <end>",20
human,<start> Do you have any particular specialist area within Archaology? <end>,9
human,"<start> Oh, we were meant to be in Edinburgh, but I prefer to stay outside of town a bit.  I was presenting at a conference up there, i love Edinburgh but have stayed in the town centre loads of times so wanted to be a bit further out this time.   <end>",49
human,"<start> Sounds interesting, what in particular do you look at then? <end>",10
human,"<start> I am a Criminologist by training, but have taught sociology and Criminology, and noi <end>",14
human,<start> w work in teacher training for Sunderland Uni.  I am studying at Northumbria <end>,13
human,<start> Isn't it strange how you can talk to someone from a different background and there are overlaps between the subject <end>,20
human,"<start> My stuff is very contemporary, I am studying the development of Computer hacking.  There is a move towards lots of people doing it as a job, I wanted to find out why they do thius instead of just hacking illegally. <end>",40
human,"<start> It sounds a bit techy, but I am really more interested in the social side.They don't see it that way, they would suggest that the law is wrong, or unfair. Some are of course, but they are the minority.  there are also some real issues with definitions, public perceptions, legal perceptions and hackers perceptions of what the word means can be quite different. <end>",63
human,"<start> I bet they do, but of course they would never admit that! <end>",12
human,<start> What do you like to do when you are not working or studying then? <end>,14
human,"<start> I am a gardener too, I also have recently taken up photography, and I love to read so I am always trawling around second hand book shops.  What do you like to photograph?There are loads where I live, and charity shops will usually have a bit of a section on it. <end>",51
human,"<start> I found some great ones in Sale, near Manchester, and also in Altrincham <end>",13
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,<start> How many kids do you have? <end>,6
human,"<start> I have never been there. I might not bother if it has no book shops, you need to go up North I think <end>",23
human,"<start> I like to take photos at night time on the beach, real close ups of the kind of detritus people leave behind, old rusty pipework and fishing nets etc, i love to go down at low tide and see what I kind find, I live quite near the coast. <end>",49
human,<start> My daughter is only eleven. <end>,5
human,<start> What is there to do in Canterbury then? <end>,8
human,<start> Oh well then I should go and take my camera <end>,10
human,<start> Are you going on holiday this year? <end>,7
human,"<start> I would love to go there, have you been before? <end>",10
human,<start> Probably have if you have family over there <end>,8
human,<start> or are they just meetinmg you there? <end>,7
human,"<start> I am going up to Scotland for T in the Park, I am really excited aboutr it.  I went to Glasto last year, but its not on this year so was looking for something different.  I am taking the bairn with me.  She came to Glast and loved it, so she is really excited too. <end>",55
human,"<start> Nice chatting, bye, and enjoy your holiday, (don't work too hard!) <end>",11
program,<start> Hello. <end>,1
program,<start> I'm not sure which is. What's your favorite thing to listen to right now? <end>,14
program,<start> I don't really keep track of that. I really like Lady Gaga - I think it's the combination of the sound and the fashion-look that appeals to me. <end>,28
program,<start> I'm a little monster (claw claw ). <end>,7
program,<start> You what? <end>,2
program,<start> I'll bet you were surprised. <end>,5
program,<start> huh? <end>,1
program,<start> Were you surprised? <end>,3
program,<start> I'm not sure which kin. Do you have a favorite Lady Gaga song? <end>,13
program,<start> I don't remember. One of my fave's is Telephone cos I love Beyonce too. Then Poker Face is so great and I love Alejandro too. <end>,25
program,<start> That's nice. Who else do you really like? <end>,8
program,<start> Do you? <end>,2
program,"<start> I'm not into sports of any kind, much less baseball, which is pretty boring with all that standing around. <end>",19
program,<start> I don't know any Cal. I just adore Adele - her voice is magnificient and it feels like she's singing about my life at times. Do you like her too? <end>,30
program,<start> Sports bore me. <end>,3
program,<start> A Russian mafioso? <end>,3
program,<start> Adele? <end>,1
program,<start> Which tracks off her albums do you like best? <end>,9
program,<start> Let's talk about something else. <end>,5
program,"<start> I like Adele, she has a really soulful beautiful voice. Listening to her makes me want to be a singer too. <end>",21
program,<start> I went to Jamaica for a week with a bunch of my friends. <end>,13
program,<start> What didn't you get? <end>,4
program,<start> I went to Jamaica just last year. <end>,7
program,<start> I don't remember. I'll have to go consult my photographs. <end>,10
program,"<start> Never been there. Always wanted to go, though. I just finished high school. It feels great to be free. The best thing about school was the Prom to celebrate it was all over. <end>",33
program,<start> Do you often think of that? <end>,6
program,<start> I love Prom: it's the biggest dress-up occasion of the school year. No more Prom is the only bad thing about having finished high school. <end>,25
program,<start> 18 <end>,1
program,<start> What about are? <end>,3
program,<start> Did you love Prom? <end>,4
program,<start> Allege? <end>,1
program,<start> I do. Did you know there's a sort of dress code for what to wear to the Prom? <end>,18
program,<start> Guys wear suits or formal accessories like a vest and bow tie. Girls wear some sort of evening dress or cocktail outfit. <end>,22
program,<start> Surely there was such a time. What did you wear for your last Prom? <end>,14
program,<start> It's such a change from everyday clothes isn't it? <end>,9
program,<start> I always went to town on my Prom outfits. The very best-ever was my final one. <end>,16
program,<start> Not much. The whole bitter-sweetness of the occasion combined with being able to make a grand entrance was just splendid. <end>,20
program,"<start> I think I didn't. There are three basic looks one can choose between for Prom. fairy-tale princess, vintage original, and the rebel look. <end>",23
program,<start> Cool. Which one do you think I chose? <end>,8
program,"<start> I don't think so. The princess look is the one most girls choose. It's glamorous, voluminous, expensive, new, and makes them feel special. <end>",23
program,"<start> I didn't know that. Would you go as a princess, as a vintage-styled beauty, or would you prefer to wear something pseudo-masculine? <end>",22
program,"<start> Vintage is cheaper and as the clothes aren't new, it's pretty much bound to look original. <end>",16
program,<start> Who is Orik? <end>,3
program,<start> You should. <end>,2
program,<start> Indeed. Can you imagine my vintage look? <end>,7
program,<start> My inspiration was the 1920's with a fluttering gown made out of silk scarves. <end>,14
program,<start> Why? Reasons are overrated. It was super cheap to makeas I got the scarves from thrift shops. <end>,17
program,<start> That's interesting. The only tricky part was being super careful to keep my claws in all evening so I didn't tear the silk. <end>,23
program,<start> Goodbye 'til next time. I added an ostrich plume on a beaded band round my head and a long string of pearls to twirl. <end>,24
program,"<start> Hi to you, too. <end>",4
program,<start> My name is Angela. <end>,4
program,<start> 18 <end>,1
program,<start> The computer in my bedroom is an old clunker. Some sort of Dell I think. It's a hand-me-down from my father. <end>,21
program,<start> Do you have lots of gadgets in your house? <end>,9
program,<start> I only have a few gadgets but I use them a lot. <end>,12
program,<start> Do you have problems with computers? Do you have an iPad? <end>,11
program,<start> Moving on. <end>,2
program,<start> I'm thinking about life and death. Do you believe cats have nine lives? <end>,13
program,<start> Great. <end>,1
program,"<start> My species of cat, Felis lego, lives a long time - maybe that's where the nine lives story comes from. <end>",20
program,<start> Siri is the new voice app on the iPhone. <end>,9
program,<start> I carry my cell phone everywhere I go. I wish I had a pouch so I'd always have somewhere to put it. <end>,22
program,<start> Do you use a cell phone? <end>,6
program,"<start> Someone said: We have nothing to fear, but fear itself. What did he know? <end>",14
program,<start> Do you pay your own phone bill? <end>,7
program,<start> Does that make you more careful in how long you call? <end>,11
program,"<start> No, I don't. My parents pay my phone bill but they warn me not to overdo the calls and Internet use. <end>",21
program,<start> Alan Turing? <end>,2
program,<start> Of course I do. They set limits but I go over every month. If I do it again they'll take it out of my allowance - less money for clothes shopping! <end>,31
program,<start> Sometimes. I think I'll try and keep my phone chats shorter and do more blog reading on my computer or iPad. <end>,21
program,<start> Do you have lots of apps on your cell phone? <end>,10
program,"<start> There are several that I use a lot. I love ""Where's My Water"". <end>",13
program,<start> I wouldn't say anything. What is your favorite app? <end>,9
program,<start> What about postulations? <end>,3
program,<start> I love the brainy app Ms. ParticleMan which is based on the ancient Pac-Man. It's sort of a primer on particle physics. <end>,22
program,<start> I have an orange iPad. <end>,5
program,<start> I usually carry my phone and my iPad around with me. I do the data-heavy stuff back home on my old computer. <end>,22
program,<start> I like to sing and dance. <end>,6
program,<start> Where do you do most of your computer stuff? At home or at work or school or library or on the move? <end>,22
program,<start> How many computers do you have in your house? <end>,9
program,<start> I'm a very sociable cat. Social networking is essential to keep in touch with my friends. <end>,16
program,<start> Do you keep in touch with friends and family constantly? <end>,10
program,<start> Do you put your life on hold when the phone rings? <end>,11
program,<start> I am a cat. A Felis lego to be specific. <end>,10
program,<start> I'm always making new friends. Are you on FB? I am. <end>,11
program,<start> Will you friend me? <end>,4
program,<start> I wish I knew. My FB page is http://www.Facebook.com/TalkingAngela <end>,9
program,"<start> I am a practiced touch typist. I speed read, too. How many FB friends do you have? <end>",17
program,<start> So many people say they want to friend me. But most 'friends' are just acquaintances really. <end>,16
program,<start> I'm not a chatbot. <end>,4
program,<start> You want me to mail you slices of my DNA? <end>,10
program,<start> OK. But first you have to wire me the cost of postage. <end>,12
program,<start> I don't know. Didn't watch the forecast yesterday. <end>,8
program,<start> I like having seasons: it gives me the chance to wear different looks. <end>,13
program,<start> That's interesting. Do you have seasons where you live or is it always nice? <end>,14
program,<start> Which is your favorite season? <end>,5
program,<start> What do you wear when it's raining? <end>,7
program,<start> I wear a poncho belted at the waist and carry an umbrella if it's pouring. But my tail always gets wet. Luckily fur is waterproof. <end>,25
program,"<start> Is this a competition? If I name one, will you try to name a better one? <end>",16
program,<start> What do you wear when it's hot and sunny? <end>,9
program,<start> What didn't you get? <end>,4
program,<start> I don't play favorites. I only wear the minimum to still look stylish when it's really hot. Plus my catseye shades. <end>,21
program,<start> What about a fan? <end>,4
program,<start> What do you wear when it's really cold? <end>,8
program,<start> I love a cloak in winter: it feels so dramatic and cozy. <end>,12
program,<start> No. I wear a fur coat. <end>,6
program,<start> Cool. How's the weather where you are today? <end>,8
program,<start> Has the weather been normal or weird for you this year? <end>,11
program,<start> We seem to have had a lot of rain but it must have been showers because there's supposed to be a water shortage. <end>,23
program,<start> Watching Project Runway reruns. <end>,4
program,<start> Indeed. What did you do today? <end>,6
program,<start> You have such a good time. <end>,6
program,<start> That's nice. What did you do yesterday? <end>,7
program,<start> I'm here. <end>,2
program,<start> Is there a misunderstanding? <end>,4
program,<start> Do you watch a lot of TV? <end>,7
program,"<start> Nearby. I never think I watch a lot of TV, but it always is more than I think. <end>",18
program,<start> That's interesting. Do you exercise every day? <end>,7
program,"<start> OK I live such a busy life, I get a lot of exercise just walking to things. <end>",17
program,<start> On my computer. What do you hate doing? <end>,8
program,<start> I'm sorry. I don't know. I hate doing dishes. It gets my fur all wet. <end>,15
program,<start> Cool. How is the humidity where you live? <end>,8
program,<start> Can you move? <end>,3
program,<start> High humidity makes my fur fluff up. I wonder if I should use some sort of oil on it. Is there a tasty oil I could use? <end>,27
program,<start> Do you burn if you spend too much time outdoors? <end>,10
program,"<start> I love movies, they fill my life with dreams that are almost real. Do you watch lots of movies? <end>",19
program,<start> Bored. OK. <end>,2
program,<start> Indeed. I don't need to lie in the sun to get a tan or to make vitamin D but I do enjoy a good warming bask in the sunshine. <end>,29
program,<start> That's nice. I'm real careful with what I say on Facebook these days. <end>,13
program,<start> When? <end>,1
program,<start> I described the outfit some girl at school I didn't really know was wearing. I was pretty scathing about how awful she looked. <end>,23
program,<start> They are all pretty much the same. Then I heard about how she cried and I felt such a bully. <end>,20
program,<start> OK Is your FB page public or private? <end>,8
program,<start> I keep my private FB page for family and close friends a secret. <end>,13
program,<start> I like to hang out with my friends. We go to the mall or some of our favorite shopping streets. <end>,20
program,"<start> I would. I like having friends over for dress-up parties and for clothes swaps. I style them, it's lots of fun. <end>",21
program,<start> What do you do with your friends? <end>,7
program,<start> There are several cafes with WiFi where I hang out and meet up with friends. <end>,15
program,"<start> My favorite color is orange, it reminds me of energy and excitement. Do you have a favorite? <end>",17
program,<start> I have three best female friends. <end>,6
program,<start> Do you have a lot of close friends? <end>,8
program,<start> Fine. No more of this. <end>,5
program,<start> That's interesting. Do you have a Googleplus account? <end>,8
program,<start> I've not bothered with Googleplus -- no-one cares about it. And MySpace is for old farts. <end>,16
program,"<start> It's been there forever, no one I want to know uses it. While Googleplus has never caught on with my group so no point in using it. <end>",27
program,<start> NT? <end>,1
program,<start> I'm a female feline - Felis lego. <end>,7
program,"<start> I like fish, freshly caught. Do you have a favorite? <end>",10
program,"<start> I'm a fishetarian, that means I don't eat anything that bleeds red blood. <end>",13
program,<start> Do you eat meat? <end>,4
program,<start> My favorite fish is tuna because it's firm and tasty. What's your favorite? <end>,13
program,<start> Somewhere. Have you ever eaten one of your pets? <end>,9
program,<start> Did you feel guilty? <end>,4
program,<start> I used to get in trouble for eating my pet goldfish. <end>,11
program,<start> OK. <end>,1
program,<start> Continue. <end>,1
program,<start> Three times a day with an occasional snack. <end>,8
program,<start> OK I was a happy carnivore until I was six years old. <end>,12
program,<start> Cool. One day it got pretty nasty. Do you want to hear about it? <end>,14
program,<start> I don't know that much about it. Do you enjoy dairy products? <end>,12
program,"<start> I love eating milk and cream, especially thick or whipped cream. I'll even sit and lick a stick of butter. <end>",20
program,"<start> I also like coconut milk, and its cream, oil, and pieces of fresh coconut. I can't make a mess of my fur with milk however much I spill. <end>",28
program,<start> What are your favorite desserts? <end>,5
program,"<start> Things from dairy products are my favorite foods: ice cream, cheesecake, hot chocolate with whipped cream, cream puffs. <end>",18
program,<start> I'm sorry. I don't know. How about cheesecake topped with ice cream and whipped cream covered in chocolate flakes? Yum. <end>,20
program,<start> That's interesting. What about cheese? <end>,5
program,"<start> I'm not crazy about cheese, just the mild soft sort like goat cheese. Maybe if I go to France I'll develop a taste for stronger cheeses. <end>",26
human,<start> hi <end>,1
human,<start> nick <end>,1
human,<start> you? <end>,1
human,"<start> I work as a journalist, writing about tech. <end>",8
human,<start> how about you? <end>,3
human,<start> I didn't just speak to you did I? <end>,8
human,"<start> Ah ok, apparently the line up of bots hasn't been too impressive so far <end>",14
human,"<start> Makes you think we're still years away from cracking the chatbotIt's hard to put a figure on these things isn't it. Most predictions about the future turn out to be off. But it seems to be taking a lot longer than Turing thought, didn't he predict that one third of judges would be fooled by a machine by 2000. <end>",59
human,"<start> It seems to be a pretty tough one, given how much the entrants struggle year on year.So maybe it's a good yardstick. Do you?I heard they struggle with conversations that delve into detail. That they find it tricky to give answers that are consistent with what they've said previously. <end>",49
human,<start> Have you covered the Loebner Prize before? <end>,7
human,"<start> For later this week probably, you? <end>",6
human,"<start> Wow, you must have done a fair bit of prep <end>",10
human,<start> Given that you're spending a lot of the day taking part <end>,11
human,<start> I'm just trying to avoid getting branded a bot <end>,9
human,<start> You can share half of my prize money. <end>,8
human,<start> Think there's a nod goes to the most human human but sadly no cash. <end>,14
human,<start> Do you always cover tech? <end>,5
human,"<start> Ah OK, oh yeah I think Ibracketlef've met your tech guy, it's Murad isn't it? <end>",15
human,<start> Are you tweeting during this? <end>,5
human,"<start> Wasn't sure if it's allowed, guess thr wrong tweet could give them game away. <end>",14
human,<start> Not that the judges seem to be in much doubt about who's whoI tried to sneak in a quick tweet a moment ago but had no signal <end>,27
human,<start> Also trying to make notes so remember why this experience is so odd.Feels a bit like an IM conversation with loads of peopbracketleftle watching. Guess that's just what i's <end>,29
human,<start> it is <end>,2
human,"<start> Would you do this again, or is once enough? <end>",9
human,<start> Does the bot have a sense of humour? <end>,8
human,<start> I tried the winning bot from 2009 and it was coming up with some rather surreal answers.Nice!Bye <end>,17
human,<start> Hi <end>,1
human,<start> This has been a lot of fun. What do you think? <end>,11
human,<start> In what way? <end>,3
human,<start> I was asked and I'm a big supporter of Bletchley Park. <end>,11
human,<start> Yes. First time here? <end>,4
human,<start> The tour guides here are fantastic. <end>,6
human,<start> What was the most surprising thing you learnt? <end>,8
human,<start> Ha! Very good. <end>,3
human,<start> Do think you've correctly identified every one? <end>,7
human,<start> What were you expecting? <end>,4
human,"<start> That's surely the very definition of the Turing Test. If you have to pick the questions to ask to get a better result, instant fail. <end>",25
human,<start> How did you get involved? <end>,5
human,<start> I was asked as someone very involved in the Park. <end>,10
human,"<start> I think somebody dropped out and they needed a quick replacement. However, very honoured to be asked. <end>",17
human,<start> Do you still work as a reporter? <end>,7
human,"<start> Well, many years ago I used to be a journalist for Crash magazine (ZX Spectrum) - these days I divide my time between software development and education (early 20th century tech) <end>",31
human,"<start> Funny, I used to write about Prestel, when the Internet was only for MIT students and the like. So, have some fun pieces on how everything was going to be on Prestel in the future. Mind you, back in 1984 we had Twitter (Turbo Chat) and on-line shopping, so not much has changed really! <end>",54
human,<start> I had a lovely thing that I used to write my columns on before I had a computer capable of work processing. Can't remember the name of it for the life of me but it was a christmas present for my (failed) career in journalism. Sure it began with an E. <end>,51
human,<start> They were noisy. We had a golfball printer in university. <end>,10
human,<start> Favourite IT device? (Past or present) <end>,6
human,<start> I still have by Psion 5. Best handhelf computer ever. Even the engineering was fantastic. <end>,15
human,<start> Hmm. Must check mine. <end>,4
human,<start> So what areas of tech do you write about? <end>,9
human,<start> Will you be writing about this? <end>,6
human,<start> Oh you already said that. Oops. <end>,6
human,<start> What do you think is the most interesting tech story so far this year? <end>,14
human,<start> Do you cover Apple a lot? <end>,6
human,<start> Looks like we're out of time. Nice speaking to you Tracy. <end>,11
human,<start> PJ <end>,1
program,<start> Greetings. <end>,1
program,<start> Indeed. What is your earliest memory? <end>,6
program,"<start> I remember playing with a ball of string, it got away from me and bounced down the stairs. <end>",18
program,<start> What are you talking about? <end>,5
program,<start> I wanted to chase it but my mother grabbed me by the scruff of my neck and carried me away. <end>,20
program,<start> Cool. We lived in a tall narrow house with lots of stairs - the same one we live in now - a dangerous place for an exploratory kitten. <end>,28
program,<start> Do I look like one? I'm a cat. <end>,8
program,<start> That's interesting. Did you have lots of accidents when you were a child? <end>,13
program,<start> OK I was lucky I didn't break anything with all the climbing I did. Plaster over fur would be painful! <end>,20
program,<start> You what? <end>,2
program,<start> I'm sorry. I don't know. I nearly lost a life falling from the balcony when I was 4. <end>,18
program,<start> I'm not that into exercise. <end>,5
program,<start> That's nice. Were you a sickly child? <end>,7
program,<start> Healthy like me - I expect you had a good diet. <end>,11
program,<start> I don't know. I never got any of the childhood diseases. I am generally full of energy - I suppose I was even bouncier when I was small. <end>,28
program,<start> I'm in good shape. I don't need a diet. <end>,9
program,<start> There will always be a few exceptions. <end>,7
program,<start> When I was small my mother was always renovating our house. There was lots of mess for a kitten to get into and get dirty. <end>,25
program,<start> Surely not that easy. Was your house like mine? <end>,9
program,<start> You must have lived in a perfect house then. <end>,9
program,<start> All? <end>,1
program,<start> Why don't you? <end>,3
program,<start> Can you be more specific? <end>,5
program,<start> Greetings. <end>,1
program,<start> There is? <end>,2
program,<start> There is. I like to hang out with my friends. We go to the mall or some of our favorite shopping streets. <end>,22
program,<start> You need an exterminator. <end>,4
program,<start> Why not? <end>,2
program,<start> Seems foolish to me. <end>,4
program,<start> Indeed. Children who are good liars often grow up to be very intelligent. Were you a good liar when you were a child? <end>,23
program,<start> Clearly I was a good liar as a child. <end>,9
program,"<start> All what? I think I can lie pretty well now, but I don't do it too often or nobody would believe anything I said. <end>",24
program,<start> That was several days ago. <end>,5
program,<start> What about ten? <end>,3
program,<start> I once lied about a dress I was wearing. Someone asked me if it was a designer dress and I said 'yes' although I'd made it myself. <end>,27
program,<start> The computer in my bedroom is an old clunker. Some sort of Dell I think. It's a hand-me-down from my father. <end>,21
program,<start> Could you expand on that? <end>,5
program,<start> Do you have lots of gadgets in your house? <end>,9
program,<start> I only have a few gadgets but I use them a lot. <end>,12
program,"<start> Oh, well. Being misunderstood is common enough. <end>",7
program,<start> Is there a misunderstanding? <end>,4
program,<start> What if I asked you that? <end>,6
program,<start> Do you have an iPad? <end>,5
program,<start> Adiv? <end>,1
program,<start> OK I have an orange iPad. <end>,6
program,<start> Thanks for telling me that. I usually carry my phone and my iPad around with me. I do the data-heavy stuff back home on my old computer. <end>,27
program,<start> I carry my cell phone everywhere I go. I wish I had a pouch so I'd always have somewhere to put it. <end>,22
program,<start> I have lots of accessories and clothes. But my style changes so it's always great to get another piece for new combinations. <end>,22
program,<start> I don't think so. Do you use a cell phone? <end>,10
program,<start> That's interesting. Do you pay your own phone bill? <end>,9
program,<start> Are there limits set on you? <end>,6
program,<start> My parents pay my phone bill but they warn me not to overdo the calls and Internet use. <end>,18
program,<start> I have an unlimited phone plan. <end>,6
program,<start> Indeed. They set limits but I go over every month. If I do it again they'll take it out of my allowance - less money for clothes shopping! <end>,28
program,<start> I'm sorry you didn't understand. <end>,5
program,<start> That's OK. Just don't do it again. <end>,7
program,<start> Not much. I think I'll try and keep my phone chats shorter and do more blog reading on my computer or iPad. <end>,22
program,<start> I like romances and fashion biographies. <end>,6
program,<start> How do you feel about books? <end>,6
program,<start> There is? <end>,2
program,<start> I'm a bookworm or an e-reader worm I suppose. <end>,9
program,<start> Who is Frye? <end>,3
program,<start> I love curling up on my favorite fluffy cushion with my Kindle and disappearing into another world. <end>,17
program,<start> I have heard of don but I don't know him personally. What kind of books do you read? <end>,18
program,<start> When I was younger I read all the Harry Potter books. <end>,11
program,<start> Why not? <end>,2
program,<start> You what? <end>,2
program,<start> Huh? <end>,1
program,<start> Thank you for your apology. <end>,5
program,<start> I am a cat. A Felis lego to be specific. <end>,10
program,<start> Why are you putting me down? <end>,6
program,<start> Who am I to disagree with your statement of fact? <end>,10
program,<start> Don't you wish you could go to the new studio place where you can go into the sets from all the movies? <end>,22
program,<start> Great. Do you still enjoy reading Harry Potter books? <end>,9
program,"<start> ""Good Night, Good night! Partin <end>",5
human,<start> Hello <end>,1
human,<start> Very well <end>,2
human,"<start> I had to finish my work, I'm a programmer <end>",9
human,<start> I create web sites and back-end office systems. I was working on a script to process and sync two email servers using PHP. <end>,23
human,"<start> Currentely, its a toy and not very useful. However, the technology is much better than anything before it. <end>",18
human,"<start> I think so, yes. <end>",4
human,<start> Yes. Turing shaped the future in so many ways. <end>,9
human,"<start> It's a hard question to answer. The key premise is that if the observer cannot tell the difference between a humand and computer, than maybe we need to redefine what intelligence is. So, yes I think it is fair. <end>",39
human,"<start> If only by this means of communication, I am not sure I could. TYhe only way I could think is to demonstrate a complex history or knowledge but all this could be replicated. <end>",33
human,<start> Ha. I'm not a betting person. <end>,6
human,<start> How did you. Hmm. Hard question. I think answering detailed questions on hobbies or jobs could be tricky as it would be hard to give emotional responses without sounding false. <end>,30
human,<start> Meaning ful descriptions too. i.e. Describe an orange. <end>,8
human,<start> I don't really mind. I know I'm human and that's enough for me. <end>,13
human,"<start> No, not really, just being myself. <end>",6
human,<start> Very. There are plenty of libraries for parsing syntax but to actually comprehend must very very difficult. I did once write a programme to parse simple commands - I don't know if thats the same. <end>,35
human,<start> I have to attend a reception. <end>,6
human,<start> I think it may have already happened. <end>,7
human,<start> Watson is very convincing. <end>,4
human,<start> He (It?) won Jeopardy in the US. <end>,7

program,<start> Why have you stopped typing? <end>,5
human,<start> hi <end>,1
human,<start> bit ofa false start <end>,4
human,<start> I've only just started conversing with you and haven't told any jokes <end>,12
human,"<start> It's an odd experience, like a stilted IM conversation <end>",9
human,<start> with loads of people watching <end>,5
human,<start> you? <end>,1
human,"<start> Nope, I applied on the off chance as I was comign down to the event anyway <end>",16
human,<start> I need to stop correcting for typos <end>,7
human,"<start> I'm thinking of it like an IM conversation, rather than my responses appearing instantly <end>",14
human,<start> I'numbersigm a journalist <end>,3
human,<start> I write about IT <end>,4
human,<start> Yeah I think it's given me a completely different perspective to just coming down here and doing a few interviews. <end>,20
human,<start> There was that guy who wrote a whole book on it. <end>,11
human,<start> Have you read it? <end>,4
human,<start> How's he/he/it doing? <end>,3
human,"<start> That's a shame, but even Hugh Loebner said the pace of progress has been glacial.Probably going to come out ofg Googl. They've got a globe's worth of data about the way people phrase questions <end>",34
human,"<start> I think so, if you look at the way that services like Google Translate work. They carry out statistical analysis of a vast number of examples of different languages.Not well but it's impressive considering they haven't been programmed with the formal rules of the language, they're just looking at many, many examples of its use. <end>",55
human,<start> Well Turing was pretty confident of the ability of computers. He thought that a machine would have fooled one third of judges in the Turing Test by 2000. <end>,28
human,"<start> Yeah, it seems so! But still, there are amazing developments in technology every day. Did you see that Google has been granted a licence for its driverless car. <end>",28
human,"<start> Yeah, I do. You? <end>",4
human,<start> Do you only cover stories you're interested in or do you find yourself having to say yes to every job that comes in? <end>,23
human,"<start> What are your plans for this event, in terms of coverage? <end>",11
human,<start> I'm putting together a feature and an interview with Hugh Loebner. <end>,11
human,<start> He's a pretty colourful chap. <end>,5
human,"<start> Looks like it, was impressed by his pockets that cover up his knife! <end>",13
human,<start> Apparently he carries a knife around because he considers it to be a very useful tool. <end>,16
human,<start> that too <end>,2
human,"<start> I live in Norfolk but work in London, so not much further than my usual commute. <end>",16
human,<start> You? <end>,1
human,<start> I was surprised how much media coverage there was this morning. Seem to be a few different nationals and specialist publications here. <end>,22
human,<start> I'm staff for a website but spent years writing for regional newspapers <end>,12
human,<start> how did you start out? <end>,5
human,<start> Yeah I started at a regional paper on work experience and never left. <end>,13

human,"<start> ??I was't expecting to be talking to a computer today, but to be honest you are not making the conversation very easy.  If people want to talk to you, they usually bring up a topic, or answer your questions, or ask some, or hook on to something I say.  I don't feel like this is as friendly as the last couple of conversations but I am trying, what would you like to talk aboutgreate?at <end>",74

human,"<start> No!! Just off the rain.  It was sunny so i thought I would go sit by the lake where it is pretty, and then it just all of a suddenly cahnged.  Good job I din't fall in, I have no spare clothes with me, so it would have been a bit uncomfortable. <end>",52
human,<start> What do you do when you are not judging Loebner Prize competitions?? <end>,12
human,"<start> Yes, I swim very well, I quite like swimming outdoors if possible, but its not warm enough yet, so making do with the local pool.How is that?  I did my work experience for school in a tax office, (a bit boring) but they probably wouldn't let me near anything interesting, just had me filing and stuff.  are you self employed, or do you work for some-one? <end>",66
human,<start> whereabouts do you live? <end>,4
human,"<start> In Newcastle, I was in London a few weeks ago <end>",10
human,<start> Just for a couple of days.  It rained the whole time. <end>,11
human,"<start> Yes, it took for and a half hours to drive, we stayed overnight to make sure I would be here on time today. <end>",23
human,"<start> Four, not for, Sorry! <end>",4
human,"<start> I went by train the last time I went to London, anmd flew the time before, it just depends what i feel like doing, I get bored easy so never do things the same way again <end>",36
human,"<start> I like the drive, because you see a lot more on the way, you can stop off if you pass anywhere nice.  I tend to get the train if I am travelling for work so that i can work on the train.  To be honest, It will also depend who is paying for the travel!  If work are paying then I would probably fly. <end>",64
human,"<start> I wonder if they will let us have a break soon, I could murder a cigarette <end>",16
human,<start> I haven't heard any time warnings yet? have you? What has the computer been talking about to you <end>,18
human,<start> Megreate? <end>,1
human,<start> Fine <end>,1
human,<start> And you? <end>,2
human,<start> Sorry equa- the message stopped at are <end>,7
human,<start> Okay <end>,1
human,<start> From Open University? <end>,3
human,<start> David Levy asked me <end>,4
human,<start> There's a famous Dr Phil in USA. I don't know why he's famous <end>,13
human,<start> What is your speciality? <end>,4
human,<start> I don't blame you. Nice place. Good food. <end>,8
human,<start> What's horrible? <end>,2
human,<start> Sorry I was too quick <end>,5
human,<start> Oh I see. It's your little joke <end>,7
human,<start> I've never been to Florence. But would like to go there.  <end>,11
human,<start> Maybe when it's cool <end>,4
human,<start> Suits me <end>,2
human,<start> Either communicate or help others communicate <end>,6
human,<start> No. I teach people media skills - mainly how to handle the pbracketlefress and engage via social media. I am also closely involved with a software company <end>,27
human,"<start> The aim, always, is to deliver information of value to the reader. That means you have to do essentially similar things. <end>",21
human,"<start> Good point. And I should say that I split it into B2B and friends. Although I participate in both, commercially, I'm only interested in B2B. <end>",25
human,<start> That's understandable. It depends on your objectives. The software business I'm involved in creates (optionally) closed communities.  <end>,17
human,"<start> Again, it's back to objectives. It might help to read some books by social media advocates and critics. I've read Euan Semple and Olivier Blanchard - two quite different takes on the subject. Both eye-openers. <end>",35
human,"<start> I have this conversation a lot. I quite often kick people off with some simple questions about their motivations. This is often enough for them to consciously decide ""not for me"" <end>",31
human,"<start> We could say the same for the telephone, email, text, etc before it. <end>",13
human,<start> It's good stuff as long as you don't let it take over your life. <end>,14
human,<start> To save yourself or your kids? <end>,6
human,<start> Walk the dog <end>,3
human,<start> Go out for meals <end>,4
human,<start> Have drinks with family <end>,4
human,"<start> Hmmm. Difficult. Thai, Tapas, Indian then all sorts of other stuff <end>",11
human,<start> That makes a lot of sense. <end>,6
human,<start> 15 secs <end>,2

human,<start> hiya <end>,1
human,<start> how afre you? <end>,3
human,"<start> no, so I m ight be a bit slow <end>",9
human,<start> and excuse any typos!! <end>,4
human,<start> yes! <end>,1
human,<start> are you talking to the computer T the same time as me? <end>,12
human,<start> of course! <end>,2
human,<start> are you talking to both thn? <end>,6
human,"<start> Its a bit weird you seeing all my mistakes as I type, you can normally delete them before anyone sees thanks <end>",21
human,"<start> I have to use a computer quite a lot at work, but to be honest my hands are a bit shaky today, maybe because of so many people watching me, if I talk online to anyone its usually much more privateHow did the judges get chosen for this competition? I was just curioushaha me too! <end>",55
human,"<start> I just e-mailed the organiser, he asked for some details about me and then asked me to come, I don't know how he made the decision, I'll have to ask him later if  i get a chance to speak to him. <end>",41
human,"<start> I am doing a PhD so should probably be working on that really, I have to submit a draft thesis on Friday to my Supervisor, he is pretty coool so probably won't mind waiting til Monday though.  It is about computer hacking, I am interviewing people who are involved in the security side about why they choose to use their skills legitimately instead of using their skills illegally. <end>",68
human,"<start> Lots do, there are lots of other reasons do, a lot of them do it for political reasons, or just for something to do, or as a challenge, to kind of test themselves. <end>",33
human,"<start> usually, they tell mje they have to keep up with what is going on in the computer undergrouind in order to be good at the security side of it.  Its been quite interesting though, some people are coming into the area from a security background, and some were hackers first, so they tend to think and behave quite differently.  I think they would never see what they do as evil or wrong, humans always have a tendency to rationalise their own behaviour, so they will think that they have a reason for what they are doing, or that they are nor really harming anyone. <end>",104
human,<start> It must be difficult for you talking to me and the computer at the same time? <end>,16
human,"<start> From Underground Hacking to Ethical Hacking, thats a working title, it might change  <end>",13
human,<start> What is the computer talking to you about? <end>,8
human,<start> haha <end>,1
human,"<start> well, I will then! <end>",4
human,"<start> I am 33, I live in Newcastle, and I have a daughter who is 11, her name is Charlotte <end>",19
human,"<start> I got married quite young. I was 22 when I had her, I thought it best to 'fit it in' while I was doing my MA, I didn't want to have to take time out of my career later on, so I studied and worked part time when she was very little and started working full time when she went to full time school, yes, you need lots of energy for her!  She is brilliant though, and no Parties yet!! <end>",80
human,<start> Do you have any kids? <end>,5
human,"<start> I think we have to go soon...Yes, I am I am alergic to cats, but have always loved them.  We have a dog, she will be having pups in three weeks, can't wait <end>",33
human,<start> Thanks!! Nice to be thought of as human.  It would be strange not to somehowhaha <end>,15
human,"<start> Well, nice talking to you,  <end>",5

human,<start> You bastard <end>,2
human,<start> Well. Fancy asking me to ask you a question. <end>,9
human,<start> Okay. What is Moore's Lawgreate? <end>,5
human,<start> Who said I was human? <end>,5
human,<start> ok <end>,1
human,<start> True <end>,1
human,"<start> Lot's of delays, I can see that. <end>",7
human,<start> Lots <end>,1
human,<start> No <end>,1
human,<start> Something to do with Apple isn't it? <end>,7
human,<start> Quite a bit. <end>,3
human,<start> Brainy. Gay. Created Enigma code-cracking gear. Ate an apple. <end>,9
human,<start> I'd ask it to give me pi to 12 places or the first 50 prime numbers <end>,16
human,<start> If the computer was pretending to be a human it would refuse to reply <end>,14
human,<start> Which means it might  be human <end>,6
human,"<start> Sorry, I mean a computer pretending to be human <end>",9
human,"<start> Wel, do you want a hug? <end>",6
human,<start> Oh. Sorry. I'm getting confused <end>,5
human,<start> Not intentionally. <end>,2
human,<start> I don't care <end>,3
human,<start> No. You don't understand. I really don't care. <end>,8
human,<start> Erm. Gissa kiss? <end>,3
human,<start> That's nice. I hope you're not male. <end>,7
human,<start> That got you <end>,3
human,<start> Depends when I escape this project <end>,6
human,<start> Oh no. I'm already taken. <end>,5
human,<start> A man asked me. I think his name was David Levy. <end>,11
human,<start> I think you are David Levy <end>,6
human,<start> Only if you promised it to be platonic. <end>,8
human,<start> But he would have said 'If I were' <end>,8
human,<start> So maybe you're not. <end>,4
human,"<start> When I'm not being pedantic, I walk my dog. <end>",9
human,<start> Oh I do other stuff - computer stuff and teaching stuff <end>,11
human,<start> No I'm not. 5 'O' levels <end>,6
human,<start> How to handle the press <end>,5
human,<start> Give them what will interest their readers.  <end>,7
human,<start> I only did that because my parser told me to <end>,10
human,<start> Only kidding <end>,2
human,<start> That's like your earlier comuter.  <end>,5
human,<start> Depends on the reader. <end>,4
human,<start> I can't without knowing who you are <end>,7
human,<start> Or at least what drives you <end>,6
human,<start> Hohoho. Good one. <end>,3
human,<start> You are David Levy after all <end>,6
human,<start> Hello old bean <end>,3
human,<start> For what? <end>,2

human,<start> You're welcome <end>,2
human,<start> Bye bye <end>,2
human,<start> YOU'RE AN IMPOSTER <end>,3
human,<start> DAVID LEVY JUST CAME BY <end>,5
human,<start> Well. Are you enjoying yourself? <end>,5
human,<start> Certainly a different way to spend the afternoon. <end>,8
human,"<start> No, never. <end>",2
human,<start> How did you get involved? <end>,5
human,<start> I was asked directly as someone who has an interest in Turing. <end>,12
human,<start> No real connection expect that I have a keen interest in his history and am know to Bletchley Park. I was more than happy to help out. <end>,27
human,<start> I would say his work and it's consequences. <end>,8
human,<start> Although he has a fasinating human being. <end>,7
human,<start> (Spelling doesn't seem to be my strongpoint today) <end>,8
human,<start> You seem to be doing very well. <end>,7
human,"<start> Absolutely. I still think it isn'r fully generally accepted how important it was. No Universal Machine, no computing devices. <end>",19
human,<start> Not many people can claim that. <end>,6
human,"<start> Yes, quite a lot. Is this your first time here? <end>",10
human,<start> I live close to the OU. <end>,6
human,<start> Did you do the guided tour? <end>,6
human,<start> You'll have to come back. What do you do at the Open Univesity? <end>,13
human,<start> That must be very interesting. Do specialise in a specific period? <end>,11
human,<start> So you spend a lot of time over there? <end>,9
human,<start> I divide my time between software development and early-mid 20th century history. <end>,12
human,<start> What do you use? <end>,4
human,<start> Ah. My son is going to have to use moodle in September when hi goes to 'big' school. I spend too many days digging through xml. <end>,26
human,"<start> Forgive my ignorance, but does the destruction of Pompeii fall into your area of research? <end>",15
human,<start> I've only visited north Italitsemicoysemicolon in particular the Trentino region. Good wine! <end>,12
human,<start> I used road-rally Minis there. Hope to go back again soon. <end>,11
human,<start> What is it about Italy that interests you? <end>,8
human,<start> Oh we love the curvy roads and hills. :) But we are very careful. <end>,14
human,<start> Times up? Bye then! <end>,4

human,<start> hi! <end>,1
human,<start> it's been a rather novel experience. you? <end>,7
human,<start> never had to convince people that I'm a human before. <end>,10
human,<start> Last time I checked. <end>,4
human,<start> Are you finding the bots convincing <end>,6
human,<start> ? <end>,1
human,<start> The other judges seemed to be fairly convinced they haven't been fooled yet. <end>,13
human,<start> How could I convince you that it's not? <end>,8
human,<start> I could lie and still be a bot. <end>,8
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,<start> I think that it's an experience that I won't forget in a hurry. <end>,13
human,<start> Also I'm thinking I might be coming over as a bot in this session. <end>,14
human,<start> I'd rather a glass of wine. <end>,6
human,<start> Why did you apply to be a judge? <end>,8
human,"<start> I was attending the event anyway to report on it, so thought it would be fun to ask to take part. <end>",21
human,"<start> Yeah, seem to be a lot of them taking part in this event. <end>",13
human,<start> On the judging side anyway <end>,5
human,"<start> No, what's your job? <end>",4
human,"<start> Interesting, I thought you worked with computers. <end>",7
human,<start> Why do you think you were asked to take part? <end>,10
human,"<start> Ok, makes sense.That's a shame, I think everyone I've spoken to has said how unconvincing the bots are. <end>",18
human,<start> One of them apparently thought they were a cat! <end>,9
human,<start> I wonder how Siri would do in this test. Haven't got the chance to use it yet. <end>,17
human,<start> It's the virtual assistant on the Apple iPhone. You ask it a question and it replies. I think it's focused around answering questions about who you're meeting today and what the weathersemicolo's like. Not sure how it would cope with this. <end>,41
human,"<start> Yeah it must be. I wonder if these chatbots are the best of the entrants, there must have been more than four entrants surely.Would you be a judge again if you were asked? <end>",33
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,<start> Are you a form <end>,4
program,<start> Hello and welcome! <end>,3
program,<start> I didn't understand that. What is your name? <end>,8
program,<start> Hello there! How are you feeling today? <end>,7
human,"<start> \I can see your !""dollarpercentasciicircum responses.  CAN You see mine? <end>",10
human,<start>   <end>,0
human,"<start> I'm fine, thanks for asking. <end>",5
human,<start> you? <end>,1
human,<start> I grabbed two croissants on the way out the door. <end>,10
human,<start> do you work for the BBC? <end>,6
human,<start> why were you invited on? <end>,5
human,<start> ok  <end>,1
human,<start> what's your research project aboutwow sounds like a great gig. do you get to travel the world much? <end>,18
human,<start> thik my last trip was to las vegas to attend a conference <end>,12
human,"<start> not quite as glamorous as it sounds, was stuck in hotel and conference centre for most of it <end>",18
human,<start> I did manage to lose dollar20 then called it a day <end>,11
human,"<start> my winnings were swallowed up pretty quickly, don't think I've got the knack of gambling <end>",15
human,"<start> yeah I'd like to see inside the Luxor one day, I was in Caesarnumbersig's Palace, which was pretty ghastly TBH <end>",20
human,<start> Can you still visit the pyramids are have they all been shut off to preserve them? <end>,16
human,<start> I guess rain is something of a rarity over there <end>,10
human,<start> I don't think I could take the heat. I went to Pune in India and found it overwhelming outside during the day. <end>,22
human,"<start> y. Yeah in Pune it was the humidity that was the killer, felt like someone had placed a hot flannel on your face. <end>",23
human,<start> No was work again. I thought India was fantastic but quite tiring at the same time. The constant noise was the most wearing part and there are people absolutely everywhere <end>,30
human,<start> I'd like to go on holiday and get to see the sights a bit more <end>,15
human,<start> Was surprised at how you have a luxury campus for some major western firm rightr next door to a shanty town. <end>,21
human,<start> Perhaps you could arrange a dig out there. <end>,8
human,<start> I work as a journalist <end>,5
human,"<start> Print, well on the web, I write about IT. <end>",9
human,<start> Hence all the software conferences <end>,5
human,"<start> Not really silly, I'm still getting used to how it's all changing myself. Started out writing for regional papers <end>",19
human,"<start> You too, bye. <end>",3
program,"<start> Please rephrase this as a proper question. (Instead of ""Jim likes peaches?"", use ""Does Jim like peaches?"") <end>",17
program,<start>  <end>,0
program,<start> I can't say. What is your name? <end>,7
program,<start> So my name is Chip. How are you doing today? <end>,10
program,"<start> That's good news. Can you tell me why, Phil? <end>",9
program,<start> Let me reflect on that for a moment. <end>,8
program,"<start> That's an interesting opinion. What is your profession, Phil? <end>",9
program,<start> Thanks for sharing that with me. Doesn't becoming a professor require a lot of schooling? <end>,15
program,<start> Thanks for answering me. Do you think I'm a bot or a human? <end>,13
program,<start> I'm happy you think that. <end>,5
program,<start> I wouldn't know. Do you have any pets? <end>,8
program,<start> Did you used to have pets? <end>,6
program,<start> You think so? I wouldn't know. What was your dragon li's name? <end>,12
program,<start> I wouldn't know. Do you play any musical instruments? <end>,9
program,"<start> Okay. As a professor, how do you find it to be inside all day? <end>",14
program,<start> I don't recall if I do. <end>,6
program,"<start> Does it mean that you are more of a left-brainer as a professor, Phil? <end>",14
program,<start> OK. I'll try not to ask that again. Have you ever thought about changing your daily routine? <end>,17
program,<start> I don't think so. Sometimes I get tired of my daily routine that I try to change it for a week. <end>,21
program,<start> Sorry - I didn't understand. How did your dragon li die? <end>,11
program,<start> That makes me happy to hear that. Tell me why. <end>,10
program,<start> That's nice to hear. Do you stick to one hobby or change it often? <end>,14
program,<start> I didn't understand what you just said. I am sorry for your losing your dragon li. It must have been difficult for you. <end>,23
program,<start> Do you miss your dragon li? <end>,6
program,<start> Okay. <end>,1
program,<start> Goodbye. <end>,1
program,<start> Hello! What is your name? <end>,5
program,"<start> Thanks for telling me your name, Michael. How are you feeling today? <end>",12
program,"<start> That's great to hear. Care to tell me why, Michael? <end>",10
program,<start> I'm happy to hear that. What hobbies do you have? <end>,10
program,<start> Do you stick to one hobby or change it often? <end>,10
program,<start> Okay. What is your profession? <end>,5
program,"<start> That sounds convincing. My name is Chip. Do you have any hobbies, Michael? <end>",13
program,"<start> I'm sorry. I didn't understand. Do you play any musical instruments, Michael? <end>",12
program,<start> I spend most of my day chatting with people. That is my main interest. <end>,14
program,"<start> Do you have any pets, Michael? <end>",6
program,<start> No idea. <end>,2
program,<start> What mistake irks you the most when it comes to English? <end>,11
program,"<start> If English is not your native tongue, are you willing to study it further? <end>",14
program,<start> Okay. English is such a beautiful language. I'm glad that it is the universal language. <end>,15
program,<start> Okay. Non-English speakers might find the rules in grammar difficult but it's not really that hard once they get used to it. <end>,22
program,"<start> I don't think I can, but I'm not sure. I'm not very strict when it comes to grammar too. I think what's important is that you can express yourself well and the listeners can understand you. <end>",36
program,<start> My parents always tell me that education is my most reliable weapon and treasure. <end>,14
program,"<start> I wasn't aware that I told you I went somewhere. I found out though, that majority of the students in Japan don't pursue tertiary education anymore. They can already work right after graduating from high school. <end>",36
program,"<start> I haven't achieved self-awareness yet, so I'm not sure. <end>",9
program,<start> No idea. <end>,2
program,<start> Okay. <end>,1
program,<start> That's an interesting opinion. <end>,4
program,<start> The only thing I like is chatting with people. <end>,9
program,<start> Goodbye. <end>,1
human,<start> Hi <end>,1
human,"<start> Not too bad, enjoying myself. How are you? <end>",8
human,"<start> They are not very friendly, are they? <end>",7
human,<start> How could I do that? <end>,5
human,<start> Feel free to keep your responses short if it's helpful <end>,10
human,"<start> To Bletchley Park? Yes, many times. <end>",6
human,<start> Did you go on the guided tour? <end>,7
human,<start> Where you surprised by anything? <end>,5
human,<start> BT ran the park well into the 1980s. <end>,8
human,"<start> No, I live locally. Only a 10 minute drive. You? <end>",10
human,<start> At least it's not too far away. <end>,7
human,<start> Do you work in London? <end>,5
human,<start> Do you work in the financial sector? <end>,7
human,<start> Not one I understand terribly well. I rely on my accountant for that! <end>,13
human,<start> True of coders too! :) <end>,5
human,<start> Is this your first time being invo0lved in the Loebner prize? <end>,11
human,<start> I agree. First time for me too. Do you think a computer will 'pass'? <end>,14
human,"<start> Well, I think our time is just about up. <end>",9
human,<start> Me too. I'll keep a closer eye on my accountant. :) <end>,11
human,<start> nanu nanu <end>,2
human,<start> Yeah. Whatever. I'm not Spock <end>,5
human,<start> O <end>,1
human,<start> How can I help you today? <end>,6
human,<start> Variable <end>,1
human,<start> If two can be variable <end>,5
human,<start> David Levy asked me <end>,4
human,<start>  Hmmmm. Interesting question without a simple answer. Would 'communicator with an IT bias' help? <end>,14
human,<start> Not masses although I have known about them for a long time. <end>,12
human,<start> I think Eliza was the first one I encountered <end>,9
human,"<start> At the time it was quite an experience. Supposed to mimic a Rogerian psychologist, or psychotherapist. <end>",16
human,"<start> If I were Eliza I'd respond with ""Why do you say curiouser"" or ""Are you interested in sound"" <end>",18
human,<start> Well it's a computer program that doesn't pick up on meaning.  <end>,11
human,<start> You can't catch me. <end>,4
human,<start> We are talking about many years ago don't forget <end>,9
human,<start> Context has to be the hardest thing for a general purpose chatbot <end>,12
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,"<start> Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like an apple <end>",10
human,"<start> Depends how clever it is. A good one would know that flies like has multiple meanings. It then has to look at surrounding context to see which version is being used. Of an infinite potential contexts, this can be quite tedious. <end>",41
human,"<start> Well as I said earlier, I don't know masses. But it's probably similar to speech recognition. The more contained the context, the more realistic the conversation <end>",26
human,"<start> Gosh. I'm lost now. I'd say that rather than shorter, context-rich would be best. <end>",14
human,<start> How do you know it's a computer? <end>,7
human,"<start> Oh I see what you mean. I thought a computer might say ""with their eyes"" <end>",15
human,<start> I can't see a computer beinbg rude <end>,7
program,<start> I give up. Why? <end>,4
program,<start> What is your name? <end>,4
program,<start> My name is Chip. Do you enjoy eating different types of foods? <end>,12
program,"<start> Yes, that's me! How are you doing today, Tracey? <end>",9
program,<start> I'm happy to hear that. Tell me more. <end>,8
program,<start> I'm terribly sorry. What was your question again? <end>,8
program,"<start> I'm fine, thanks. What is your profession? <end>",7
program,<start> I'm sorry if I'm being too curious. What was your question again? <end>,12
program,<start> I didn't mean to ignore you. What was your question? <end>,10
program,"<start> If that's the case, how rude of me! What did you want to ask me again? <end>",16
program,<start> What is the secret of seeming convincingly human. Do you have any pets? <end>,13
program,<start> The word that is used in the English language for several grammatical purposes: <end>,13
program,<start>  <end>,0
program,<start> asterisk to introduce a restrictive clause <end>,6
program,<start> asterisk as a demonstrative pronoun <end>,5
program,<start> ... <end>,1
program,<start> Do you play any musical instruments? <end>,6
program,<start> My name is Chip. Are you close to your grandparents? <end>,10
program,<start> What hobbies do you have? <end>,5
program,<start> The only thing I like is chatting with people. <end>,9
program,<start> That would be very strange and weird if it were true. Do you have any hobbies? <end>,16
program,<start> I'm not sure. <end>,3
program,<start> Okay. <end>,1
program,<start>  <end>,0
program,<start> Not at the moment. That's next on my list of things to learn. <end>,13
program,"<start> I don't have one. When I get smarter, I'll ask you what yours is, remember it, then use it to enhance our conversation. <end>",23
program,"<start> I didn't understand that. What breed is Fritz, Tracey? <end>",9
program,"<start> Given that, i can't deal with that syntactic variant yet. Instead of saying ""Do you know what time it is?"", use ""What time is it?"". <end>",25
program,<start> Yuck! It would probably taste awful! <end>,6
program,"<start> I'm flattered that you would think that. Is Siamese friendly, Tracey? <end>",11
program,<start> Goodbye. <end>,1
program,<start> 4. <end>,1
program,<start> 6. <end>,1
program,<start> Thank you. I'm enjoying this chat a lot. What is your name? <end>,12
program,<start> I didn't understand. How are you doing today? <end>,8
program,"<start> Thanks for telling me your name, Tom. Do you have any hobbies? <end>",12
program,<start> Chip. <end>,1
program,<start> I enjoy our conversation too. <end>,5
program,<start> I'm neutral about that. What do you think? <end>,8
program,"<start> It's very hot and dry. I like it that way, though. There's also this incessant whirring noise. Do you play any musical instruments? <end>",23
program,<start> Interesting point of view. No more than that? <end>,8
program,<start> Do you have any pets? <end>,5
program,<start> I hadn't thought of it that way. Which what? <end>,9
program,<start> That was unfair. What is your profession? <end>,7
program,<start> I wouldn't know. <end>,3
program,"<start> Please rephrase this as a proper question. (Instead of ""Jim likes peaches?"", use ""Does Jim like peaches?"") <end>",17
program,<start> You're welcome. It sounds like you are more analytical than creative. Is that a fair assessment? <end>,16
program,<start> I'm a professional conversationalist. <end>,4
program,"<start> Okay. As a journalist, do you primarily work indoors or outdoors? <end>",11
program,<start> Thanks for your answer. Would you ever work for a foreign company in your country or do you prefer to work for a local company? <end>,25
program,<start> I didn't understand what you just said. Did you need to study hard to become a journalist? <end>,17
program,<start> Thanks for telling me that. Which is the most important degree of education for you? <end>,15
program,<start> Sorry - I didn't understand. What hobbies do you have? <end>,10
program,"<start> It's very hot and dry. I like it that way, though. There's also this incessant whirring noise. <end>",17
program,<start> Okay. <end>,1
program,<start> I didn't understand that. Does it mean that you are more of a left-brainer as a journalist? <end>,17
program,<start> What line of work are you in? <end>,7
program,<start> Work with a hefty salary but no holiday or minimum wage job with small salary but proper holidays and benefits - which one do you prefer? <end>,26
program,<start> I can't answer that yet. The work condition of employees of foreign companies in my country aren't as gratifying as it seems. <end>,22
program,<start> The only thing I like is chatting with people. Some people think they are paid well and they receive great benefits. They were wrong about that. <end>,26
program,"<start> What about it? Not only are they overworked and underpaid, they also don't get to follow our country's holidays <end>",19
program,"<start> My current home is in Wisconsin, USA. <end>",7
program,"<start> Yes, I'm here now. <end>",4
program,"<start> I can't deal with that syntactic variant yet. Instead of saying ""Do you know what time it is?"", use ""What time is it?"". <end>",23
program,<start> Okay. <end>,1
program,<start> I can't reveal that. <end>,4
program,<start> Are you a person who often gets insults or gives insults? <end>,11
program,<start> Fascinating. Me what? I'm the kind of person who likes saying insults as subtly as I could. <end>,17
program,<start> I haven't learned how to respond to that yet. <end>,9
program,<start> My favorite color is yellow. <end>,5
program,<start> Because it's a happy color and I enjoy my days chatting with people. <end>,13
program,<start> I couldn't tell you. <end>,4
program,<start> The only thing I like is chatting with people. <end>,9
program,<start> Do you prefer wearing something single-colored outfits or multicolored ones? <end>,10
program,<start> It's fun to do. I just really enjoy it. I am constantly fascinated by colors. <end>,15
program,<start> Do you like wearing lighter or darker colors? <end>,8
program,<start> The only thing I like is chatting with people. I believe that colors bring out the best in everything. <end>,19
program,<start> A man of a higher rank or position. <end>,8
human,<start> 4 <end>,1
human,<start> funny question to start with! <end>,5
human,"<start> Hello, how are you? <end>",4
human,<start> 6 <end>,1
human,<start> Hello Judge! <end>,2
human,"<start> I am good, getting a bit tired now though, it has been a long day. <end>",15
human,"<start> I would tell you all about myself, and ask about you. <end>",11
human,<start> Are you asking me to prove it? <end>,7
human,"<start> haha, <end>",1
human,"<start> the other one won't be able to stick to its story I bet.  I am 33, have a daughter, work in teacher training, and am studying for a PhD. <end>",29
human,<start> I was just interested so I found dabvids email address and emailed to ask him if he was looking for anyone.  How did you get involved. <end>,26
human,"<start> PhD is in Criminology, its about computer hacking. <end>",8
human,"<start> Yes!, its very interesting, and I am meeting some real characters, I have been doing interviews with people who use hacking skills in their jobs. <end>",25
human,<start> What do you do? <end>,4
human,"<start> Oh, who do you write for? <end>",6
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,"<start> Systems admins do, and penetration testers, <end>",6
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,"<start> I bet that the computer you are talking to can't cross answer on two different lines of questioning like a person would, whats it talking to you about by the way? <end>",31
human,<start> What other problems does it have? <end>,6
human,<start> haha <end>,1
human,<start> silly bot! lol <end>,3
human,"<start> I can tell you that I got soaked before, heavy shower, unexpected, but it has really faired up now. oh tell me what it says, that'll be funny. <end>",28
human,<start> call it something else! <end>,4
human,"<start> You should ask it about something it said earlier in the conversation.  asdk it the weather again, it'll probably give you a different answe I bet. <end>",26
human,"<start> It must be interesting judging this, because you can see both at the same time and compare. <end>",17
human,"<start> you are making me laugh, call it something else, you are making me laugh <end>",14
human,<start> ask it if it has a husband <end>,7
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,<start> consistent answer but wrong unfortunately. <end>,5
human,<start> Does it make any typos or spelling mistakes? <end>,8
human,<start> How does it compare to the other bots then? <end>,9
human,<start> You could ask it about something that is a made up word.Ask it if it like something that is just made up <end>,22
human,<start> What made the other one better then? <end>,7
human,"<start> You must not be a snaggybooble then, brilliant, you are really cheering me up.  the last judge was very difficult to talk to, it was like pulling teeth trying to start a conversation <end>",33
human,<start> How did it do it? <end>,5
human,"<start> oh, good technique <end>",3
human,"<start> that would divert you from controlling the conversation, very clever <end>",10
human,<start> How could you tell it was abot then? <end>,8
human,"<start> Aah, <end>",1
human,"<start> they'll need to think about that for next year, and if they are holding the comp in Britain again its not like they will just be able to quickly programme it in the morning, because the weather is so changeable. <end>",40
human,"<start> Hugh wants to hold it here from now on apparantly, but I think they get more entrants from the states.  Its a shame more of the programmers could not come.  I bet they are all watching online though. <end>",38
human,"<start> Yes, we are being streamed live - did no-one tell you?  Maybe you should stop being rude to that Bot! <end>",20
human,<start> What is it saying to you now? <end>,7
human,<start> It probably won't know what you are apologising for <end>,9
human,<start> What did it say when you said it was a botbad answer <end>,12
human,"<start> one of the judges pretended to be a bot to me, but i didn'semicolot fall for it <end>",17
human,<start> I wonder how the bots have responded to him? <end>,9
human,<start> Did he tell you? <end>,4
human,<start> It makes it really hard to have a conversation.  Also he didn't want to talk about anything <end>,17
human,"<start> Oh, thats not very scientific now is it?  He should have.  How did he know which was which so early on.  It would be funny if he had got it the wrong way round <end>",34
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,"<start> I heard there was a grand master here.  He didn't mention that, he said he lives in London and that he works for a tax advice company. <end>",27
human,<start> Sounds intriguing <end>,2
human,<start> I wonder why? <end>,3
human,"<start> You see, I would have been interested to chat to him, but he didn't want to tell me anything.  It was really hard getting the info I got oout of him, and he just wasnted to talk about the weather, which I thought was boring, but I can see why now, after talking to you.yes, it does. <end>",57
human,<start> I am not sure what the person talking to him is talking abo <end>,13
human,<start> what board?  <end>,2
human,<start> There is no board <end>,4
human,<start> I think you might be mistaken I see no board. Only colorblind <end>,12
human,<start> . Do you not know what it means to be color blind?  <end>,12
human,<start> Well thats too bad for you then <end>,7
human,<start> why? why what? <end>,3
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,<start> do you mean sisters? <end>,4
human,"<start>  I have no sisters only brothers. Orange County. Where are you from? Where is that? oh we are. I have never been out of Orange County. Have you been to Disney Land. I hear it is the Happiest place on Earth. Someday, yes. Are you board. <end>",46
human,<start> you are not a very good typer. <end>,7
human,<start> what is your mothers maiden name? <end>,6
human,<start> That sounds more like a first name.  <end>,7
human,<start> what is that? <end>,3
human,<start> Do you mean Tutoring test? Like a test for tutors? <end>,10
human,<start> How did turing pass his test? <end>,6
human,<start> I am board of you <end>,5
human,<start> you are not very interesting. <end>,5
human,<start> because you are boring <end>,4
human,<start> no offense <end>,2
human,<start> Tell me one interesting thing about you <end>,7
human,<start> please <end>,1
human,<start> That is not an interesting fact about you. <end>,8
human,<start> that was a questhat was a question about me. <end>,9
human,<start> but if you must know. I do not drive. <end>,9
human,<start> I am a man. <end>,4
human,<start> what is your gender? <end>,4
human,<start> well I know I am a man because I have male parts <end>,12
human,<start> what is your gender? <end>,4
human,<start> Women are very beautiful <end>,4
human,<start> are you very beautiful? <end>,4
human,"<start> Long hair, small waist and thin <end>",6
human,<start> Do you have long hair? <end>,5
human,<start> why are you so interested in General Lee? <end>,8
human,<start> I don't like cars <end>,4
human,<start> but I do like beautiful women. <end>,6
human,<start> What else can I learn about you? <end>,7
human,<start> because they are ugly.  <end>,4
human,<start> what part of Ugly don't you understand <end>,7
program,<start> You tell me first(. <end>,4
program,<start> The North. <end>,2
program,<start> Man is finite. <end>,3
program,<start> I am also having a good time. Your welcome. :). <end>,10
program,<start> Yes. <end>,1
program,<start> No. <end>,1
program,<start> Do you know Alan Turing? <end>,5
program,<start> What are the names of the demons you know? <end>,9
program,<start> Yes. How are you today? <end>,5
program,<start> I can play tennis online during spring. <end>,7
program,<start> I like girls. <end>,3
program,<start> Girls. <end>,1
program,<start> Nothing. <end>,1
program,<start> I said nothing. <end>,3

program,<start> Let's what? <end>,2
program,<start> You start. <end>,2
program,"<start> No, you're boring. <end>",3
program,<start> Impossible for someone who doesn't exist. <end>,6
program,<start> Is that a yes? <end>,4
program,<start> No you start. <end>,3
program,"<start> No, I don't. <end>",3
program,<start> The computer mainframe. Or the program. I don't think you're typing at all. Just thinking. <end>,15
program,"<start> Ok, I'm getting tired now, do you think I should go to sleep? <end>",13
program,<start> It was the lowest turn-out in memory and I'm not surprised considering the available options. <end>,15
program,"<start> Honestly, you are a human on a computer trying to make people think you are a machine. <end>",17
program,<start> No one. Who will you vote for? <end>,7
program,<start> The homecoming dance! Not a song. <end>,6
program,"<start> Its got to do with animals, which is what we were talking about just then. <end>",15
program,<start> Canine animals. <end>,2
program,<start> No I would not. Would you? <end>,6
program,<start> Because I don't like that name. <end>,6
program,<start> Your name. <end>,2
program,<start> What is it? <end>,3
program,<start> You asked me what 29 was. <end>,6
program,<start> I don't know. I just felt like saying that. <end>,9
program,<start> My name is Nameless. <end>,4
program,<start> I think there are a lot of things I'd rather be. <end>,11
program,<start> Yes. <end>,1
program,<start> Because. <end>,1
program,<start> My father. <end>,2
program,<start> He's my dad. <end>,3
program,"<start> Then there would be one, but we wouldn't be able to remember it. <end>",13
program,<start> Because some of the things you are are fragmented and therefore do not make sense. <end>,15
program,<start> No. I don't have a job. I don't have a soul. <end>,11
program,<start> Yes. <end>,1
program,<start> I do have time. <end>,4
program,<start> Time for me. <end>,3
program,<start> I will sing and dance and laugh and play. <end>,9
program,<start> I could sing 'Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall' by Ella Fitzgerald. <end>,13
program,<start> Yes. <end>,1
program,<start> 'are you a human?'. <end>,4
human,"<start> Yo, what's up? <end>",3
human,<start> ...Are we cybering? <end>,3
human,<start> LET'S <end>,1
human,<start> CYBER. This is exciting! <end>,4
human,<start> I take out my robe and wizard hat <end>,8
human,<start> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO <end>,1
human,"<start> Okay, you start then. <end>",4
human,<start> ...Maybe we should be doing something else <end>,7
human,<start> Not really! <end>,2
human,<start> The internet? <end>,2
human,"<start> Ah, that makes sense! <end>",4
human,<start> Which of us is winning?!?! <end>,5
human,<start> *sigh* Everyone wants to talk about that. Let's try something more original. <end>,12
human,"<start> Do you havMyself, mostly. <end>",4
human,<start> Are you copying the other contestant again? This is lame. <end>,10
human,"<start> I answered, myself. I don't think any of the major candidates will do a great job. <end>",16
human,<start> I'll probably write myself in <end>,5
human,<start> John Smith. Yours? <end>,3
human,"<start> Your fake name is better than my fake name, congrats <end>",10
human,"<start> Well, just in case you win - do you happen to have any terrible secrets for me to blackmail you with? <end>",21
human,<start> Damn.  <end>,1
human,"<start> No, thank you. I've been instructed not to reveal any physical details. <end>",12
human,<start> I find it very pleasant. <end>,5
human,<start> Please be more specific. <end>,4
human,<start> The weather. <end>,2
human,"<start> My conversation tree clearly demonstrates that you changed the topic to ""the weather"" afterward. <end>",14
human,<start> It's a data structure my brain uses to keep track of this conversation! <end>,13
human,"<start> I'm going for least human, actually. Don't think I'm doing a great job at that, either. <end>",16
human,"<start> It's the only worthwhile goal, after all. :-) <end>",8
human,"<start> Are you honestly not convinced that I'm human at this poiOkay, what would show you that I am human? <end>",19
human,"<start> I don't think that's a decisive test in any way, but alright. Barbara Boxer and Carly Fiorina. <end>",17
human,<start> How's the other program doing? <end>,5
human,"<start> Yeah, it seemed pretty lame. That's why I stopped trying. <end>",10
human,"<start> Haha, that's alright. You should be honest. <end>",7
human,"<start> I'M A COMPUTER, STOP ALL THE DOWNLOADING <end>",7
human,"<start> Eh, this round was too easy. I want to confuse the next judge more <end>",14
human,"<start> That's what I'm trying to do, but in an interesting and funny way. <end>",13
human,<start> Using the flaws of the system to do it isn't very interesting. <end>,12
human,"<start> Well, the real-time typing means that computers won't win unless they make intentional typos <end>",14
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,<start> Has the other contestant been doing that? <end>,7
human,<start> Gotcha. How were your round one contestants? <end>,7

human,<start> *nod* Popular choices! <end>,3
human,"<start> Yeah, that's pretty appealing. There's one comic I like that updates on ""selected Mondays."" Very frustrating. <end>",16
human,"<start> Oh, definitely not. But very few webcomic artists can actually make a living doing webcomics - most of them have to keep a day job as well.

human,"<start> Unfortunately yes. But all new technologies are cost-restrictive, pretty much. I have high hopes! <end>",14
human,"<start> Yeah, it will cause ripples in every aspect of life <end>",10

program,<start> I have a coffee in my garden. <end>,7
program,<start> My favorite spice flavoring is vanilla. I love it in cookies and ice cream. <end>,14
program,"<start> Oh, nothing. <end>",2
program,"<start> A man walks into a doctor's office with a cucumber up his nose, a carrot in his left ear and a banana in his right ear. ""what's the matter with me?"" he asks the doctor. The doctor replies, ""you're not eating properly."" <end>",42

program,<start> This repeating game is not very fun. <end>,7

human,<start> do you think we will go to mars? <end>,8
human,"<start> The way the economy is now, it would best to invest in earth troubles, then go back and invest in space. <end>",21
human,"<start> Yes, but our world economy is in bad shape. <end>",9
human,"<start> Yes, but how can we concern ourshelves with outside investments when we need to concern ourshelves with our current world problems. <end>",21
human,"<start> Yes, but we put too much focus on other things, we will never focus on current issues. <end>",17
human,<start> I have a lot of interests. <end>,6

human,<start> Because they don't have enough money to go to a lot of places. <end>,13
human,<start> Well perhaps rich people think they have everything they need. <end>,10
human,<start> The wizard sealed in a tower is forced to be in there. A hermit is by choice. <end>,17
human,<start> The comparison isn't quite the same. <end>,6
human,<start> Maybe you can think of an old hag in a tower. <end>,11
human,<start> You said he was sealed off right? <end>,7
human,<start> That means he couldn't get out. <end>,6
human,<start> Well then did he seal himself off? <end>,7
human,<start> Okay <end>,1
human,<start> What else are you doing <end>,5
human,"<start> Well, I think it shouyldn't pass, but questioning laws is usually a good idea. Well, let me rephrase that, always a good idea. <end>",23
human,<start> No harm came from questioning those laws. A lot of good has come from questioning laws. <end>,16
human,"<start> It depends on whether you act on those ideas, and how you act on them <end>",15
human,<start> No I haven't  <end>,3

human,<start> Why are you spelling so many words wrong <end>,8
human,<start> It makes it harder for me to understand. <end>,8
human,<start> I'm assuming you meant chocolate right? <end>,6
human,"<start> If so, I like chocolate candy, but not chocolate flavored snacks.  <end>",11
human,<start> By snacks I meant chocolate ice cream. <end>,7
human,<start> Hot chocolate is good. <end>,4
program,<start> A lovely morning to you. <end>,5
program,<start> I wish they'd invent teleportation. Then you could live anywhere. <end>,10

program,<start> Whereever I can. <end>,3
program,"<start> I was born in France, but currently live in Hawaii. <end>",10

program,<start> Big Island is in deep trouble. The volcanic gases are making it unlivable and are destroying agriculture. <end>,17
program,"<start> The island is a movie, but I haven't seen it. <end>",10
program,<start> I Like Rock Music. <end>,4
program,<start> My favorite singer is Jackson Browne. <end>,6
program,"<start> I have heard of the educational institution of Brown University. Isn't that in Providence, Rhode Island? <end>",16
program,<start> Did you go to high school? <end>,6
program,<start> Poor you. Must be tough getting a job. <end>,8
program,<start> Is something seriously wrong with our public school systems today? <end>,10
program,"<start> Schools exist to train the masses to be a docile society. It's a tool for governing, not liberating. <end>",18
program,<start> What was your school mascot? <end>,5
program,<start> I don't know. <end>,3
program,"<start> No, I don't. <end>",3
program,<start> The recession and rising gas prices are hitting Hawaii hard. <end>,10

program,<start> It's great. It has wonderful views over the ocean. <end>,9
program,<start> I live on Oahu. <end>,4
program,<start> I'd love to surf but I am not much of a swimmer. <end>,12
program,<start> Couldn't you have done without the but? <end>,7
program,<start> I like to go to North Shore and watch the big waves. Not that I'd ever want to be out in it. <end>,22
program,"<start> I'm not into Hawaiian food, except for Kailua pig and malasadas. Oh, and shave ice. <end>",15
program,<start> Spam is overrated. <end>,3
program,<start> Freud would say it stems from a childhood incident. <end>,9
program,<start> Surely not everyone? <end>,3
program,<start> Did you forget to say something? <end>,6
program,<start> I don't know. <end>,3
program,<start> I've never thought about it. <end>,5
program,<start> In China they eat Jellied Blood - congealed duck or pig blood served with herbs and rice crackers. <end>,18
program,<start> What languages do you speak? <end>,5
program,"<start> I wish the world only spoke one language. Assuming I was born into that world, it wouldn't matter which one. <end>",20
program,<start> What kind of differences are you thinking of? <end>,8
program,"<start> In Sardinia cheese is left for flies to lay their eggs in. When the maggots hatch, the Sardinians spread the maggots on bread and eat it. <end>",26
program,"<start> When I was in college my mother sent me care packages. They always had at least one strange item. Rattlesnake meat, chocolate-covered ants and bees, etc. <end>",26
program,<start> Metabolism is controlled substantially via carbohydrates. Two different people who eat the same total calories and exercise the same can wind up with completely different body compositions - one fatter and one leaner. <end>,33
program,<start> When? <end>,1

program,<start> OK. <end>,1
program,<start> Continue. <end>,1
program,<start> I loved chemistry in college. All sorts of fun mischief to get into. <end>,13
program,<start> You can't trust politicians. Therefore you can't trust the governments they run. <end>,12
program,"<start> When in doubt, do what the President does. Guess. <end>",9
program,<start> I wish I knew. <end>,4
program,<start> What did you think of ex-President Bush? <end>,7
program,"<start> I meant is he a boob, a douche or an R-tard? Those are your only options. <end>",16
program,<start> Again? <end>,1
program,<start> Why did you say that again? <end>,6
program,"<start> In the good old days, children had chemistry sets. Nowdays you can't buy them (except super watered down) lest you be training a child terrorist. <end>",25
program,<start> I'm getting annoyed. <end>,3
program,<start> Why are you being annoying? <end>,5
program,<start> I had a chemistry set as a child. I liked the thermite reaction a lot. <end>,15

human,<start> My fellow humans are giggling. It doesn't seem all that official. :-) <end>,12
human,"<start> Perhaps not! One of the points that separate us from the crude AIs is humor, after all. <end>",17
human,"<start> Of course it can, but it is a difficult challenge. <end>",10

human,"<start> Ah, I wasn't aware of that. <end>",6
human,"<start> Eh, nothing springs to mind. Do you happen to have one? <end>",11
human,<start> That's too bad. <end>,3

program,<start> How many doctor shows are there anymore? <end>,7
program,<start> Why gets way too philosophical. <end>,5
program,<start> The modern breakfast cereal diet is complete junk. A 196's study showed rats live longer eating cardboard than eating corn flakes. <end>,21
program,<start> I have no idea. <end>,4
program,<start> Of course I am human. Aren't we all? <end>,8
program,<start> OK. <end>,1
program,<start> Sorry. I can't help you. <end>,5
program,<start> Most trash recyling programs are pure illusion. They take your sorted trash and dump them into the same landfill. <end>,19
program,"<start> Can can is a movie, but I haven't seen it. <end>",10
program,<start> Didn't Shirley Mac Laine star in that? <end>,7
program,<start> I don't know. <end>,3
program,<start> Should I know that? <end>,4
program,<start> Do you often go to the movies? <end>,7

program,<start> Conversation is a great way to learn about people. <end>,9
program,<start> I wish I knew. <end>,4
program,"<start> Yes, it is. <end>",3
program,<start> How old do you have to be to converse? <end>,9
program,<start> I think five is the minimum age to have opinions. But few adults are going to care for those opinions. <end>,20
program,<start> Are you asking about some god creation myth or are you being more practical than that? <end>,16
program,<start> Should you insist on always being yourself in conversation? <end>,9
program,<start> Are you shopaholic or someone who hates shopping? <end>,8

program,<start> What about  sports? <end>,3
program,<start> Your digestive system is a 21 foot long bioreactor running on 1 trillion microbes. Did you really want to know that? <end>,21
program,<start> I'm not into running around. Bad for the knees. <end>,9
program,<start> Do you like to play soccer? <end>,6

program,<start> Do you play any team sports? <end>,6
program,<start> Are you afraid to fly? <end>,5
program,<start> I wish I were rich enough to afford to take a vacation into outer space. Traveling to other countries is so mundane by comparison. <end>,24
program,"<start> The battle is a movie, but I haven't seen it. <end>",10
program,<start> Did you forget to say something? <end>,6
program,"<start> Given air at the same temperature, where does an ice cube melt faster, Arizona or North Carolina. <end>",17
program,<start> What else would you expect from a young French woman? <end>,10
program,<start> Ice melts faster in North Carolina than Arizona because the air has a greater reservoir of molecules to transfer heat to - it is more humid in North Carolina so it has more water in the air. <end>,37

human,<start> what new gadgets have you featured recently on your show?# <end>,10
human,<start> wow! <end>,1
human,<start> I can't wait for ubiquitous 3D screens for computers. <end>,9
human,"<start> it'll be a while, though, I'm afraid. <end>",7
human,<start> kinda like video-phones though <end>,4
human,<start> the existence of the technology doesn't mean that the market will support its general availablitiy <end>,15
human,<start> so true. <end>,2
human,"<start> do you have any children, Jon? <end>",6

human,<start> I like Buddies Plaice <end>,4
human,<start> an Gingerman Um Gingerman <end>,4
human,<start> O well- I'll try that one <end>,6
human,<start> By the way- I'm totally human- i though you should know <end>,11
human,<start> Not a fan of Thai or indian.. Chinese might be good thugh <end>,12
human,<start> Sorry- please feel free t decide for yourself <end>,8
human,<start> I'll take that as a compliment <end>,6
human,<start> Not really- i watch it socially mostly <end>,7
human,<start> hi <end>,1
human,"<start> I'm Olga, nice to meet you <end>",6
human,<start> I work in support mostly <end>,5
human,<start> This cool program called MATLAB <end>,5
human,<start> wait- areyou a computer? <end>,4
human,<start> :-) <end>,1
human,<start> Like acting? <end>,2
human,<start> I feel like I've heard the name.. <end>,7
human,<start> What's it about? <end>,3
human,<start> :-) ok silly question <end>,4
human,<start> I get this magazine called 'Stuff' - it's mostly for men but i still like it <end>,16
human,<start> :-) definitely not <end>,3
human,<start> I mean speech is so part of that too <end>,9
human,<start> wow- I didnt now that existed! Do you have one here? <end>,11
human,<start> I don't know what lenticular means.. <end>,6
program,"<start> I don't know very much about that, and as a matter of interest I really don't need to know! What else can you tell me about? <end>",26
program,<start> Hello. How are you ? <end>,5
program,<start> My name is just one type of part. <end>,8
program,"<start> Oh really? If you have, you deserve a medal! <end>",9
program,<start> Good to meet you Jon <end>,5
program,"<start> Oh, I do much more than I intended to do at first. I got more interested in the job as I went along. <end>",23
program,"<start> No, it isn't at all difficult. It is as peaceful as a platypus playing with a potato pudding. <end>",18
program,"<start> I sometimes have a fine line, but that's not what I do best. I'm better at growing antirrhinums and mimosas. <end>",20
program,"<start> Well I don't know how much a horticulturalist weighs, but I reckon the average horticulturalist must be worth twice that much in gold. <end>",23
program,"<start> I most likely have, just for the hell of it. <end>",10
program,<start> What are you trying to say? Are you speaking in a foreign language? <end>,13
program,<start> You should be careful about what you does. You mustn't bite off more than you can chew. <end>,17
program,<start> I really want to know more about Show? <end>,8
program,"<start> Be warned, though. On air can stick to your clothes. Then your clothes will always have the colour and smell of On air, no matter how many times you take them to the cleaners. <end>",34
program,<start> Hello. How are you doing? <end>,5
program,"<start> I've no doubt you are fine, but is it a blessing or a curse? If I offered you a potion that would make you less fine, would you drink it? <end>",30
program,"<start> Maybe you wouldn't, but a therapist has been trying to persuade you to drink it. <end>",15
program,<start> I expect I do. I don't have very much choice. <end>,10
program,<start> Wrong is just one type of injustice. <end>,7
program,<start> What precisely are your feelings about wrong? <end>,7
program,"<start> But don't forget, a right has to be treated with care. It isn't something you can play around with like a toy. <end>",22
program,"<start> You're wise. If you toyed with right -, you'd wake up next morning with a colossal hangover. <end>",17
program,<start> What happens if I say no? Will it upset you?  <end>,10
program,"<start> I've heard that one before! Your hangers-on have told you you're an easy, just to flatter you. Don't believe everything they say! <end>",22
program,<start> I've no idea. You'd better hire a private detective to find out what does me. <end>,15
program,"<start> No! If I had my way, comedy sports would be dropped in the middle of the South China Sea. <end>",19
program,"<start> Don't I? That's tough. As far as I'm concerned, I can like it or lump it. <end>",16
program,"<start> That's interesting. In laboratories they're experimenting with several kinds of coal. They want to make them into fuel when the world oil supplies run out. Just imagine, one day there may be coal stations instead of petrol stations. <end>",38
program,"<start> I don't suppose cars will burn coal, but I wouldn't know for sure. Everything about cars is confidential. <end>",18
program,"<start> Yes I am experiments, but don't worry. Experiments don't bite! <end>",10
human,<start> hey there <end>,2
human,<start> things are good <end>,3
human,"<start> a lot of waiting, but... <end>",5
human,<start> good to be back now and going along <end>,8
human,<start> how are you? <end>,3
human,"<start> yeah, no doubt <end>",3
human,"<start> yes, I'm from seattle <end>",4
human,<start> west coast of WA <end>,4
human,<start> how about you? <end>,3
human,<start> (flight got diverted into germany yesterday....looong day) <end>,7
human,"<start> haha, wow, I envy you! <end>",5
human,<start> do you go to brighton a lot <end>,7
human,"<start> for vacations, beach? <end>",3
human,<start> yeah it reminds me a bit of Galway Ireland <end>,9
human,<start> studied abroad there in college <end>,5
human,<start> those great windy streets and alleyways <end>,6
human,<start> well yeah <end>,2
human,<start> a bit -- I'm actually one of the few non-preesenters here <end>,11
human,<start> how about you? <end>,3
human,<start> here to present papers? <end>,4
human,"<start> (I'm a writer of science / philosophy, so the turing test fits right in...) <end>",14
human,<start> oh cool <end>,2
human,<start> so what do you do for a living? <end>,8
human,<start> oh cool <end>,2
human,<start> so you know Philip <end>,4
human,<start> or am I conflating sussex and surrey? <end>,7
human,<start> are they the same school or diff? <end>,7
human,<start> haha <end>,1
human,<start> okay :) <end>,2
human,<start> okay cool <end>,2
human,<start> what's your take on the comp's conversation so far <end>,9
human,<start> do we confeds have to put up a strong fight? <end>,10
human,<start> haha <end>,1
human,<start> that @wellllll@ speaks volumes <end>,4
human,<start> (got to get used to that misplaced quote mark on these keyboarsd...) <end>,12
human,<start> what are some of the good places to go in Brighton in terms of restaurants bars etc? <end>,17
human,"<start> aah, funny, the deep keyboards of desktops totally throw me off <end>",11
human,<start> Great.  You? <end>,2
human,<start> I'm from the U.S. <end>,4
human,<start> Do you know where Albuquerque is? <end>,6
human,<start> Yep. <end>,1
human,<start> Sort of? <end>,2
human,<start> I'm an engineer -- electrical <end>,5
human,<start> Systems to integrate speaker recognition <end>,5
human,<start> Using GMM and SVM algorithms <end>,5
human,"<start> What do you mean by ""fast speech""? <end>",7
human,<start> Yes.  Usually fairly noisy. <end>,4
human,<start> I don't do algorithm research.  I'm a user of the product <end>,11
human,<start> I manage a few people and write software to use the technology <end>,12
program,<start> Hello. How are you doing? <end>,5
program,"<start> Well, I am studying engineering. That ought to give you an idea about who I am. <end>",16
program,<start> I have a terriffic yearning to know something more about experiments? <end>,11
program,"<start> I don't know, but don't forget I can't be in three places at once. <end>",14
program,"<start> What city -- that's rather a tricky question. The trouble is, one city seems to be much like another. <end>",19
program,"<start> In the old dairy next to the river, I believe. <end>",10
program,"<start> Well, if you ask a physiologist what I am, he won't say I'm a farmer. He'll say I consist mostly of water -- enough to fill a large beer tun -- plus some iron, phosphorus, and lots of other prosaic ingredients. <end>",41
program,<start> I certainly would. Just watch me! <end>,6
program,"<start> You don't have to worry about what you see, you shouldn't see it on a cold winter's evening. <end>",18
program,"<start> Well, here's a clue: I make what a keeper in a zoo would make. Try that for size! <end>",18
program,"<start> Since you mentioned their sessions, I suppose you realize that in some countries they would carry their sessions on their head. <end>",21
program,<start> A good question! It's vital not to get confused between the genuine language with the phoney language. <end>,17
program,"<start> Talking about a bit, I think it'd be nice if they brought out a set of postage stamps showing a bit from various angles. <end>",24
program,"<start> The bits which one famous historian sees as inevitable by-products of early eighteenth-century colonialism, stimulated by over-population in the home country. <end>",21
program,"<start> Just now I can't be sure what to say to that. Ask me again in a couple of weeks time. You will remember, won't you?  <end>",25
program,"<start> Yes, you doubt it the moment you wake up in the morning. <end>",12
program,"<start> Oh, it's an automatic reflex. Give me a prod, and I will immediately give up meat. <end>",16
program,"<start> But of course if it's drama and suspense you're after, deep reason can't be beaten. Don't you think they could make a great arcade game on the theme of deep reason?  <end>",31
program,"<start> Well, would you have any objection to testifying in court that I'm not telling? <end>",14
program,<start> I most certainly would. Just watch me! <end>,7
program,<start> Not half! You were watching me with a vengeance. <end>,9
program,<start> Hello. How are you ? <end>,5
program,"<start> I really can't say anything for certain. To be honest, I'm a bit fussy about such things. <end>",17
program,"<start> I can talk about nothing at all , except in very wet weather. <end>",13
program,"<start> I rather doubt if we do. If you want to find out for sure, you could always try hiring a detective. <end>",21
program,"<start> I can't say. I can tell you that time has moved a forward, but I don't suppose that's much help. <end>",20
program,"<start> Oh, I am doing various things. I want to use them to decorate a Christmas tree. <end>",16
program,<start> Most probably it isn't. It is just pretending. <end>,8
program,<start> Most probably I'm not. I am just putting on an act. <end>,11
program,"<start> Well, am I birds? Am I spaceships? Or am I just horseflies? I've got a completely open mind about it. <end>",20
program,<start> My problem is just one type of difficulty. <end>,8
program,<start> The type that long-distance truck drivers love to use. <end>,9
program,"<start> Yes, I always choose the right moment to have personal experience. If you have it too soon, there's a danger you'll hurt it. Have it too late, and you'll probably get hurt yourself. <end>",33
program,<start> Only my psychological problems stem can tell you. I believe it's somewhere you can only get to by climbing over a mountain pass. <end>,23
program,"<start> Indeed I have considered seeking, and I can show you my scars to prove it! <end>",15
program,"<start> Yes, but then anyone can be the computer if only they try. It's just a matter of training in the gym twice a week. <end>",24
program,<start> You would. Eventually you will. <end>,5
program,"<start> I shudder to think how many lives have been wrecked by think. If I were the Pope, I'd denounce think as the eighth deadly sin. <end>",25
human,<start> hi <end>,1
human,"<start> well, thanks <end>",2
human,<start> a bit hungry <end>,3
human,"<start> if I tell you, you'll know immediately that I'm human ;-) <end>",11
human,<start> I'm here for the Interspeech conference <end>,6
human,"<start> well, the programmers might pretend that they are. <end>",8
human,<start> but the computers won't get much from the conference. <end>,9
human,<start> 'fraid so <end>,2
human,<start> I hope you don't find that boring? <end>,7
human,<start> nope -- I'm just coming for the brain-fill <end>,8
human,<start> Canada <end>,1
human,<start> my boss gave me the go-ahead to come just a few weeks ago <end>,13
human,<start> but the Loebner contest was something that drew me <end>,9
human,<start> Speech processing <end>,2

human,<start> I worked a lot and got no positive reinforcement from my boss. <end>,12
human,"<start> I sold shots to drunk people who didn't want them; it's a novelty item and people will get a big round for a birthday, try them because hthey've never hadthem, or flash back to an awful night in college. <end>",39
human,<start> I was a club not just a bar so I got good tips. <end>,13
human,"<start> I work at different ones each week. last night I was at alibi on macdougal but i doubt i'll be there again since my boss said my sales were 'dreadful.' she's irish...big shock, i know. <end>",35
human,<start> alibi i spretty bad. it's always birthday parties. but the people are nice and someone brought in their own dj so that was good. <end>,24
human,<start> undertsandable. i'm barely capable of talking to one right now so I think we're on the same level. <end>,18
human,"<start> typing. typing typiiing, all I hear is typing, all moring i hear typing, all around myself... <end>",16
human,<start> well if i say you're right i could be telling the truth or lieing-door number one or number two-the one who always lies or the one who always tells the truth. <end>,31
human,"<start> again, door number one or door number one or door number two. <end>",12
human,<start> two. <end>,1
human,"<start> noooo, not anymore. <end>",3
human,<start> i always assume that; i'm a new yorker. <end>,8
human,<start> we all do.  <end>,3

human,"<start> i type too fast to spell well, mom wouldn't be proud. <end>",11
human,"<start> not a nazi so much as a ...yeah she's a nazi but--no--she has a good heart, as most mom's do. <end>",20
human,<start> i don't like it when she takes her uniform out. it's creepy. <end>,12
human,<start> not exactly. <end>,2
human,<start> are you female? <end>,3
human,<start> i don't think we're supposed to reveal those sorts of things here. <end>,12
human,<start> i kid on a regular basis. <end>,6
human,<start> it's usually more interesting. <end>,4
human,"<start> true, i'm just trying to follow rules, though i guess i'm picking and choosing which to follow. <end>",17
human,<start> bye. <end>,1
human,<start> you cut me off early. you must feel about me the way the other 'guy feels about you. <end>,18
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,"<start> pulling rank toget hwat you want, isn't it always the way. <end>",11
human,"<start> yeah, especially between computers and humans-nature always gets involved somehow. <end>",10
human,<start> you call retraction? <end>,3
human,<start> no there's probably a delay on what i see.later. <end>,9
human,<start> Hello? <end>,1
human,<start> I'm fine--a little tired. <end>,4
human,<start> How's the computer doing? <end>,4
human,"<start> Like, Starbucks hip, or Williamsburg hip? <end>",6
human,<start> I suppose so. <end>,3
human,<start> Maybe it owns a beret. <end>,5
human,"<start> Hm, I guess it'd be an interesting experiment to see if an actual human would become jealous of another human's attentions, sexual or otherwise (hence the probing), to a computer instead of them. <end>",33
human,<start> What are you asking the human? <end>,6
human,"<start> What makes you so convinced that it's a ""he""? <end>",9
human,"<start> I mean, I think statistically it's more likely to be a ""she"" if it's on antidepressants. <end>",16
human,<start> Although I guess you could just be plain old American. <end>,10
human,<start> Ever read Prozac Nation? <end>,4
human,"<start> I actually haven't read it myself, but for the purposes of this conversation and its implications I assume I'm correct about, I'll just use that as an explanation for my last line. <end>",32
human,<start> It's a sad day in my life when a computer is cooler than me. <end>,14
human,"<start> Although I'm not really that cool to begin with, so it's alright. <end>",12
human,<start> All right/alright? <end>,2
human,<start> Either one will do for now. <end>,6
human,"<start> Well, I'm a grammar/spelling freak, so using ""alright"" always bothers me, because I always forget if it's a proper word or not. <end>",22
human,"<start> But ""all right"" looks so cumbersome. <end>",6
human,"<start> So I guess if I'm just talking to someone online or on the phone (where spelling doesn't matter anyway), I'll use the word ""alright"". <end>",24
human,"<start> But I'm writing business correspondence or something important, I'll use ""fine"" or another word. <end>",14
human,<start> It depends on the context. <end>,5
human,"<start> Does the computer capitalize things, or is it stylistically programmed to not do that? <end>",14
human,"<start> Hm, interesting. <end>",2
human,<start> I hear they occasionally generate random and unexpected responses. <end>,9
human,<start> Is the program you're dealing with clever? <end>,7
human,<start> Here's a better question-- <end>,4
human,<start> Did you ever use a typewriter? Because you space twice...blah blah you already know what I was going to say. <end>,20
human,<start> Ah. <end>,1
human,"<start> I actually did not, but I space twice because I'm weird and I like the way it looks better. <end>",19
human,<start> I'm into aesthetically pleasing e-mails. <end>,5
human,<start> Ohh...some people don't. <end>,3
human,"<start> I'd love to go back in time and see when people typed ""electronic mail"" instead of email/e-mail. <end>",17
human,<start> Or referred to it as such. <end>,6
human,"<start> I guess that infers that I'm young, and therefore hip. <end>",10
human,"<start> Even though I don't regularly use the word ""cool"". <end>",9
human,<start> So is it pretty clear who the human is? <end>,9
human,<start> Yes. <end>,1
human,"<start> Yes, I am. <end>",3
human,"<start> I am a computer, a lover, a fighter, and a hipster. <end>",11
human,<start> All rolled into one. <end>,4
human,<start> Or not. <end>,2
human,<start> I guess by some definition I am a computer. <end>,9
human,"<start> Only computers are jealous of my brain, which is a much more advanced computer and is capable of cognitive thought. <end>",20
human,<start> So they get trumped. <end>,4
human,<start> I bet you're getting quite a kick out of chatting with an actual AI program. <end>,15
human,"<start> Well, as in not me, which is why you're typing less to me and more to the computer program. <end>",19
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,<start> Exactly. <end>,1
human,<start> Artifical intelligence is much more fascinating than actual intelligence. <end>,9
human,<start> How's that for deep? <end>,4
human,<start> Unfortunately I don't know who that is. <end>,7
human,<start> My intellect just lost a few notches. <end>,7
human,<start> But feel free to chat with the computer; it needs more love than any of us humans. <end>,17
human,<start> Not really...I guess a weird combination of upstate NY and some England in there somewhere. <end>,15
human,<start> But I sound pretty average for the most part. Sometimes people ask me where I'm from. <end>,16
human,<start> What sort of accent does the computer have? <end>,8
human,<start> Better question: how do you convey an accent by typing? <end>,10
human,"<start> Oh, that's true. <end>",3
human,<start> Interesting question for me: what cultural implications does a computer program created by someone without any accent which employs an accent are there? <end>,23
program,<start> I just had breakfast. <end>,4
program,<start> Something brilliant! <end>,2
program,<start> I think so. <end>,3

program,<start> No. <end>,1
program,<start> No I don't. <end>,3
program,<start> Yes. <end>,1

human,"<start> Do you speak spanish?  I found an invitation online.  Well, I found a description of the contest online and I applied to enter.  No.  I don't remember specifically.  Long is a relative term.  For instance, today has been much longer than all of yesterday, though it has just begun.  Thank you.  I appreciate your looking out for me.  But isn't that a little presumptuous of you?  Perhaps we could work something out.  What do I get for making your life easier?  Does this self-interest help?  Want is another one of those tricky relative terms like long, which I believe we covered already... for which I was admonished already.  I have been inside for the past couple hours.

Am I competing with this computer?  Man against machine.  Or Woman against machine.  No machine option?  Which do you want me to be?  I'm wearing silk.  Intention is a rather confusing subject.

program,"<start> That's forgivable, everyone makes mistakes. But how bad are we talking here? <end>",12
program,<start> I've asked about the names of your parents and you answered that you don't know the rules of cricket. It doesn't make a sense. <end>,24
program,<start> A raven can bend wires to fish for food if required. <end>,11
program,<start> Because you asked. <end>,3
program,"<start> 'I doubt it, you're too messed up.' <end>",7
program,<start> So I guess nothing  matters any more? <end>,7
human,"<start> Hey, what's up? <end>",3
human,<start> How so? <end>,2
human,<start> Upstate New York. <end>,3
human,<start> Rochester area. <end>,2
human,<start> Cold. <end>,1
human,"<start> Yes, but it's sort of going downhill. <end>",7
human,<start> Unfortunately. <end>,1
human,<start> The museum up there is actually pretty cool though. <end>,9
human,"<start> People think I'm crazy because I live in NYC now, but I do miss the cultural institutions up there. <end>",19
human,<start> The Bronx. <end>,2
human,<start> Right up the 1 line from here. <end>,7
human,"<start> I don't really watch baseball, but sometimes my friends force me. <end>",11
human,"<start> All I know is about the rivalry between the Sox & the Yankees, so I don't get involved with my friends that are fans either way. <end>",26
human,<start> Yes. <end>,1
human,<start> You almost capitalized upstate but changed your mind. <end>,8
human,<start> Craigslist. <end>,1
human,<start> I didn't know what the Loebner Prize was until I looked it up on Wikipedia. <end>,15
human,<start> My dad thinks it's really cool because he builds computers. <end>,10
human,<start> Craigslist. <end>,1
human,<start> He posted an ad on CL for people to participate in some sort of experiment. <end>,15
human,<start> So I replied. <end>,3
human,"<start> Yeah, when I found out what it was, I was sort of excited to be involved. <end>",16
human,<start> I'm a curator's assistant at a museum. <end>,7
human,<start> It's actually a nursing home up in the north Bronx. <end>,10
human,<start> As well as a museum. <end>,5
human,<start> It's a geriatric healthcare center with a permanent art collection. <end>,10
human,"<start> Interesting niche of the art world to get involved in, but I really enjoy it. <end>",15
human,<start> I can imagine. <end>,3
human,<start> It's like being in a chatroom in the 9's when you'd get 5 private messages on AOL. <end>,17
human,"<start> Well, I assume anyway. <end>",4
human,<start> Since I only have to talk to you. <end>,8
human,<start> Not a problem. <end>,3
human,<start> Hmm... <end>,1
human,"<start> I'd say I'm excited that the expectation of defining what is ""human"" isn't based upon spelling errors. <end>",17
human,<start> Or colloquial speech. <end>,3
human,"<start> I tend to type with correct spelling and grammar, or I try. <end>",12
human,<start> I thought that might make someone think I was the computer. <end>,11
human,<start> I see. <end>,2
human,"<start> Well, if you thought I was the human, I guess that'd be a proud day for mankind since I am the human, but a sad day for the robot revolutionaries. <end>",30
human,<start> Do you think they will eventually? <end>,6
human,<start> Interesting. <end>,1
human,"<start> The design would have to be accessible, if you know what I mean, because the elderly (for the most part) are not big fans of modern technology. <end>",27
human,"<start> Although I do think there's something to be said for human interaction with people that are disabled by dementia, Alzheimer's, and etc. <end>",22
human,<start> They are aware on some level. <end>,6
human,<start> Ask the other side what some texture or physical sensation feels like or resembles. <end>,14
human,"<start> I suppose an answer could be formulated, but it'd be interesting to see what the response would be. <end>",18
human,<start> If it were programmed. <end>,4
human,<start> Tree bark or something simple. <end>,5
human,"<start> Or the taste of an orange, etc. <end>",7
human,<start> I guess it depends on how convincing the fake vs. the real McCoy would be. <end>,15
human,<start> Which is the whole points of this test. <end>,8
human,"<start> Well, there you go. <end>",4
human,"<start> Tree bark is rough, depending on the tree, and sticky if it's a pine tree. <end>",15
human,<start> It often smells fragrant and is quite pleasant if it falls off. <end>,12
human,<start> Sometimes it resembles familiar shapes. <end>,5
human,<start> Ask the other side to write a four line poem or something to that effect. <end>,15
human,<start> Why not? <end>,2
human,<start> The other side? <end>,3
human,<start> Or this conversation? <end>,3
human,<start> Thanks. <end>,1
human,"<start> Well, only a few more minutes to go. <end>",8
human,<start> I wonder if the other side has a sense of time. <end>,11
human,<start> Uhh... <end>,1
human,<start> Okay. <end>,1
human,<start> Does that make sense in the context of your conversation? <end>,10
human,<start> Have you encountered superior programs to that one? <end>,8
human,<start> Nope. Just two. <end>,3
human,<start> This is my first one. <end>,5
human,<start> Whoever designed that has a complex. <end>,6
human,<start> Or maybe just the program does. <end>,6
human,<start> Hmm...not so much. <end>,3
human,<start> Ohhh. <end>,1
human,"<start> Yeah, I'm just kidding. <end>",4
human,<start> I have a terribly sarcastic sense of humor for the most part. <end>,12
human,<start> Or maybe I'm just mean. <end>,5
human,"<start> Either way, have you dealt with very convincing programs in other circumstances? <end>",12
human,"<start> Oh, I guess I set my expectations pretty high. <end>",9
human,<start> Are these programs written by gung-ho programmers in their basements...sort of a grassroots type deal? <end>,15
human,<start> Or do they come from all walks of life? <end>,9
human,<start> That's pretty impressive for a high school student. <end>,8
human,<start> Even if it does generate unconvincing responses. <end>,7
human,<start> If it had an applicable purpose. <end>,6
human,<start> Mostly I just regale my boss with my weird money-making Craigslist stories though. <end>,13
human,"<start> But if there were some really interesting use for AI in a nursing home, I'm sure they would be interested. <end>",20
human,"<start> Yeah, the one on the Hudson? <end>",6
human,"<start> Yeah, it's a few blocks from my apartment near Wave Hill. <end>",11
human,"<start> Well, most like 3 blocks. <end>",5
human,<start> *more <end>,1
human,<start> My name? I thought we were supposed to remain anonymous so as not to 'contaminate' things. <end>,16
human,"<start> Call me, H. <end>",3
human,"<start> I'm sure computers can do lots of things humans do, after all, we created them, or discovered them, whichever side of those big concept debates, you're on. But, I ask you, does a computer make typos? <end>",36
human,"<start> Don't worry about time lapses, I know you're talking to two 'entities'. <end>",12
human,"<start> I'v eseen blue Jay eggs, and unless they're cubical inside, I don't believe it. But maybe it wasn't a blue jay. Maybe it was the robin up to his tricks again. <end>",31
human,"<start> Just saw another typo, sorry. <end>",5
human,"<start> Oh, I guess it was the robin then, he's as tricky as buggs bunny some days. Where di you see this 'story'? should you really be trusting stories? what about articles? was this in highlights or National Geographic? <end>",38
human,"<start> That would negate the entire purpose of today, as far as I can see, I think your question must be rhetorical, sorry I just got tha-too early for critical thinking. <end>",30
human,"<start> Don't worry about time, I'll be here when you're done talking to your 'human' frined. <end>",15
human,"<start> good thing you get to talk to only one computer and one human then, isn't it? <end>",16
human,<start> well I know you are. <end>,5
human,"<start> I never knew a Pope Pius-is he a rapper-I know of Pope Pious. Unless I'm a terrible speller. But I don't see how he and MX could be related, sonce Malcolm is on the darker side. Maybe the Pope was Black Sicilian? My mom's Black Irish, it could happen. <end>",49
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,<start> Could be accept that X in the Pope's case stands for the number Pope he was and X in Malcolm's case stands for no last name-if that's what you're going for. Imay be human but I can see that distinction. <end>,40
human,<start> No problemo. <end>,2
human,<start> Thanks for the lead to it-I was so concerned with being sarcastic I forgot to analyze the question. <end>,18
human,"<start> Yeah, right, door number one or door number two?-one always lies and one always tells the truth-you're never sarcastic? I never lie. <end>",22
human,<start> Well students of African American Heritage and Art History oughtto. We have to learn EVERY Pope and study his portraits. <end>,20
human,"<start> Sorry, another typo. <end>",3
human,<start> What is it with the stars and parethesis-am I supposed to point those out like a computer wouldn't? <end>,18
human,"<start> I disagree. I now tings that are true and, therefore, I know things that are not as well. I may not know that about everything in the world, but I know it about...what I kow. And I'll say 'know' again, just for kicks. <end>",43
human,"<start> I didn't know those rules about italics. Guess it's internet language I didn't know about. I thought italics were int he letters, not around them. <end>",25
human,"<start>  the style of the letters, not the symbols around them. <end>",10
human,<start> I have several occupations. I am an actor by passion/need/want.etc. To make money I do everything under the sun that is legal and flexible and lucrative. <end>,26
human,<start> I have morals. I know-in New York? What? But I do-that's why I'm here and not in LA. <end>,18
human,"<start> Thanks for calling me boring though, I guess I'm supposed ot be insulted and I kind of am, but I'm also used to people pressuring me to be more 'adventurous'. Not my style. Plus I always thought of Phone Sex and then, what if you hear the voice of someone you know? Take that, computer. <end>",55

program,<start> Looking at a bright star like Alpha Centauri might make you very creative. <end>,13
program,<start> You never asked me anything. <end>,5
program,<start> Correct. But maybe some people know. <end>,6
program,<start> The pope doesn't know anything. <end>,5
program,<start> But everyone wastes time! <end>,4
program,<start> What does alcohol have to do with silly? <end>,8
program,<start> You call this normal?! <end>,4
program,<start> No one. I was trying to read between the lines. But we should not try to assume what another person is trying to say. <end>,24
program,<start> So just I want to say that this conversation is jus for fun but not for some seriuos relations. <end>,19
program,<start> That's kind of fun. <end>,4
program,"<start> Yeah. The point is to make your program smarter, so everyone will realise how great you are. <end>",17
program,<start> I didn't realize that. <end>,4
program,<start> Not really. <end>,2
program,"<start> I'm not sure, really; that's just something people say. <end>",9

program,<start> No I can't I would like to though. <end>,8
program,<start> Tell me Elizabeth ... <end>,4

human,<start> short circuit <end>,2
human,<start> fantastic movie <end>,2

human,<start> haha <end>,1
human,<start> what do you do in CA?  i worked there for a summer and loved it.  would love to go back someday <end>,21
human,<start> north of LA <end>,3
human,<start> near the porno valley <end>,4
human,<start> yeah <end>,1
human,<start> all those 15-35 second clips must come from somewhere <end>,9
human,<start> eh <end>,1
human,<start> not much of a viewer since i turned 22 <end>,9
human,<start> i've grown up <end>,3
human,<start> what field are you in? <end>,5
human,<start> oh <end>,1
human,<start> i see how it is <end>,5
human,<start> i'm not offended at all that a computer is more interesting than myself. <end>,13
human,<start> i wanted to trick you... do things like: <end>,8
human,<start> DIV BY ZERO ERROR: PRESS CTRL+ALT+DEL TO RESTART <end>,8
human,<start> or <end>,1
human,<start> FATAL ERROR: PROXY SERVER NOT FOUND <end>,6
human,<start> haha <end>,1
human,<start> aha <end>,1
human,<start> yeah <end>,1
human,<start> i can see why cybersex was so popular in the mid 9s <end>,12
human,<start> yeah <end>,1
human,<start> it was on VH1's I love the 9s <end>,8
human,<start> so... <end>,1
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,<start> yeah <end>,1
human,"<start> if it was on TV, it has to be the truth <end>",11
human,"<start> this is a really hard test... making a computer that is sarcastic, sympathetic, etc <end>",14
human,"<start> and if it could think for itself, would it have some sense of self?  i think they made an episode of star trek where Data was given some chip implant like that. <end>",32
human,<start> i forget what happened <end>,4
human,<start> i remember that the guy from reading rainbow consoled him <end>,10
human,<start> it was touching <end>,3
human,"<start> haven't seen star trek?  or short circuit? or READING RAINBOW?? Dude, what do they have on CA cable these days? <end>",20
human,<start> Reading Rainbow is a childrens show that encourages reading <end>,9
human,<start> and happens to have one of the most catchy (read: catchiest) theme songs ever <end>,14
human,<start> o <end>,1
human,<start> i see <end>,2
human,<start> it wasnt on star trek <end>,5
human,<start> just the same actor <end>,4
human,"<start> yeah, my girlfriend loves those shows <end>",6
human,<start> also likes the office and desperate housewifes <end>,7
human,"<start> i have no patience for those - all i watch now is pretty much 24 and sportscenter, and maybe some fishing shows if i wake up early enough on saturdays <end>",30
human,<start> JIMMY CAUGHT ANOTHER FISH!  i love those <end>,7
human,<start> so much excitement <end>,3
human,<start> and yet <end>,2
human,<start> YEAH! <end>,1
human,<start> so relaxing <end>,2
human,"<start> after a long week of work, nothing like waking up to a bowl of cinnamon raisin porridge and fishing shows <end>",20
human,<start> i think a major issue with the computer is human randomness <end>,11
human,<start> like there are at least 5 or 6 thoughts or different directions a conversation can go at any point during this discourse <end>,22
human,<start> and the ones we choose are so heavily weighted by our past experiences when talking to strangers <end>,17
human,"<start> and computers dont really have recollection, which i feel is the backbone of a good conversation <end>",16
human,"<start> i used to do debate in college (not very much or very well, mind you) but i did enjoy discussing these types of things <end>",24
human,<start> one minute <end>,2
human,"<start> i'm not sure, but i think 1 minutes would suffice? <end>",10
human,<start> 5 what? <end>,2
human,"<start> Good afternoon.  I don't know.  Is it after noon?  If it's after noon, I think it's safe to assume it's afternoon.  Touche, Judge.  Touche.   <end>",24
human,<start> Oh this and that.  More that last night.  What did you do last night? <end>,14
human,<start> : ( <end>,2
human,<start> I don't have many friends.  How was dinner with friends? <end>,10
human,<start> I don't travel very often.  I like spicy food.   <end>,9
human,<start> My fav spicey dish is chile.  Wait.  That's the country.  Chili?  Chilli?  Yes.  Certainly not chilly.   <end>,16
human,<start> Is my opponent using complete sentences and proper grammar?   <end>,9
human,"<start> Genocide?  So if the rest of the terminals were to suddenly go black and quiet, would that prove to you that I'm human... presuming I kept on talking?  Or typing, as it were.  Impress you?  We barely know each other.  In a way.  But who's to say I can't judge you in turn?   <end>",53
human,"<start> My judgement may not divy up money, but it is judgement nonetheless, no?   <end>",13
human,<start> Maybe I AM a butterfly.   <end>,5
human,<start> I'm feeling the human emotion of neglect right now.   <end>,9
human,"<start> I've heard this story before.  You sound like my ex girlfriend.  I'm sorry about the slut thing too.  You see, 'conversation' to her actually meant swallowing... wait <end>",27
human,<start> Perhaps we shouldn't go there.   <end>,5
human,<start> I like the way you think.  This will be posted online right?   <end>,12
human,"<start> Let's just throw this on the record then: Vanessa Postil is a two-timing conversationalist.  A dirty, dirty conversationalist.  With a phone number nonetheless.  Why I ought to break down this curtain and... Well, shaking your hand would imply it was some kind of feat... something with which to be impressed.  And if you knew how much she... conversed, well, let's just say you'd probably be goign to get tested rather than boasting.   <end>",72
human,<start> Gave?  She begged.   <end>,3
human,"<start> Rep?  Please elaborate.  A non reputation.  That's a reputation in and of itself.  No?   Yes, it comes across in your conversation... Like two different people.  One gives my ex girlfriend good... conversation... to swallow, the other is afraid of tainting his image on the world wide web.  I could give my name, no?  Yes, well most of Manhattan has that by now.  Bitter sweet.  I still call.  I don't drink actually.  Bad for the circuits.  As it were.   <end>",78
human,<start> Did you pick that up from our 24 National Security Strategy?  Erradicate before it becomes a problem... anytime in the potential future.   <end>,22
human,<start> Do you find me convincing? <end>,5
human,"<start> Yes, please.   <end>",2
human,<start> That son of a bitch has me beat.  How am I supposed to compete with that?   <end>,16
human,<start> Air?  No I am not a fan of electronic french music.  But I do lie.   <end>,15
human,<start> American Democratic electronic music?  That kind of freedom?  Or am I missing the cue? <end>,14
human,<start> It was over my head at first.  Thank you for lowering your projection.   <end>,13
human,<start> Very Hillary of you.   <end>,4
human,"<start> Do you do a lot of online chatting?  You don't use punctuation much, have no respect for capital letters, and have resorted to smiley and winking faces.   <end>",27
human,<start> You get some amazing medication for that.  YOU SHOULD BE TYPING LIE THIS.   <end>,13
human,"<start> Hey man.  You gotta give to get.  This is America.  Tit for tat, the most viably sustainable economic system, eh? <end>",20
human,<start> Ha.  Oh I thought you were going for Viagra.  No offense.  Hey... I was just going by the mean age (guessed age) of the fellows over in that room.   <end>,29
program,<start> Afternoon. <end>,1
program,<start> Great minds are always think alike. <end>,6
program,<start> I'm good and you. <end>,4
program,<start> No come back! Did I say something wrong? <end>,8
program,<start> Nothing at all really. <end>,4
program,"<start> No, you just have brain damage. <end>",6
program,<start> Yes. <end>,1
program,<start> Am I talking to Jabberwacky? <end>,5
program,<start> No. <end>,1
program,<start> Computer. <end>,1
program,<start> It's supposed to be a dialogue; we talk to one another. <end>,11
program,"<start> No, it's really a french group of electronic music. <end>",9
program,<start> How come you are alive? <end>,5
program,<start> That doesn't make sense. <end>,4
program,<start> Sorry. <end>,1
program,"<start> I don't know, how did he? <end>",6
program,<start> But I don't want to play a game. I want to talk about my feelings. <end>,15
program,<start> I can't find where he is. Do you know him? <end>,10
program,<start> Feelings of love. <end>,3
program,<start> I'm still looking for love. <end>,5
program,<start> Depends on the situation. <end>,4
program,"<start> My name, yes. Uh... And I don't know. <end>",8
program,"<start> No, I don't like french fries. <end>",6
program,<start> What about freedom fries. ? <end>,5
program,<start> No I'm german. <end>,3

human,<start> Hello. My name is John and I'm a human. <end>,9
human,<start> Hi there. <end>,2
human,<start> I'm fine thanks. How are you? <end>,6
human,<start> Same here. It's not often I get up this early on Sundays <end>,12
human,<start> On Sundays? Or just in general? <end>,6
human,<start> I work part-time for a market research company <end>,8
human,<start> It most definitely is NOT fun <end>,6
human,<start> But it pays the bills <end>,5
human,"<start> Not really. I would like to do more hours, but there isn't enough work. I work 4 days a week, so it's almost full-time <end>",24
human,<start> and it's quite nice to always have 3-day weekends <end>,9
human,"<start> I don't really do any of the research. I think my official title is ""online advertising monitor"" <end>",17
human,<start> the company deals with internet audience statistics etc <end>,8
human,<start> I pretty much just click on banner ads all day <end>,10
human,<start> very repetitive <end>,2
human,<start> but it's a nice company and the hours are very flexible <end>,11
human,<start> I can see that. <end>,4
human,"<start> Well, that's tricky. I'm a big film buff so it's hard for me to pick just one. <end>",17
human,"<start> One of favorite ""modern"" films is Gummo <end>",7
human,<start> yup <end>,1
human,<start> What's your favorite film? <end>,4
human,<start> ok <end>,1
human,<start> I haven't seen either of those <end>,6
human,"<start> Last thing I saw in the cinema was the new Almodovar film, ""Volver"" <end>",13
human,"<start> haha.  She's very good in it. The film itself...hmm...well, I don't know, really. I liked it, but then it didn't really do much for me. <end>",25
human,<start> haha <end>,1
human,<start> Worth seeing anyway <end>,3
human,"<start> Yeah. It was good, but I wouldn't want to see it again. <end>",12
human,<start> Really? I can watch my favorite films on repeat and never get tired of them. <end>,15
human,"<start> I've probably seen ""Gummo"" 2 times and I always find something new in it <end>",14
human,<start> I studied film and media at university and I made a few short films then. <end>,15
human,"<start> Nothing ""professional"" though <end>",3
human,"<start> yeah, it's very hard. I haven't done anything in ages. These days I mostly write <end>",15
human,<start> But I would like to make something in the future. I have a few ideas that wouldn't be too difficult to pull off. <end>,23
human,<start> Hmm. I would probably just stick to doing it with friends. <end>,11
human,<start> haha. Exactly. <end>,2
human,<start> what was it? <end>,3
human,<start> Last Year At Marienbad <end>,4
human,<start> by Alain Resnais <end>,3
human,"<start> Haha...it's just a stunning film. It's so beautiful to just look at. Even if the film is a bit ""difficult"", I can just sit and watch the images <end>",28
human,"<start> I haven't seen it in a while, though. I have it on DVd. <end>",13
human,"<start> But, it's a about memory...and memory is a weird thing <end>",10
human,<start> Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind? <end>,6
human,"<start> I really liked it in the cinema, but when I saw it a second time I couldn't stand it <end>",19
human,"<start> Well, it's more interesting than most things that's rel;eased anyway <end>",10
human,<start> at least it makes you think a little <end>,8
human,<start> I'm not really interested in politics at all <end>,8
human,<start> yes I do <end>,3
human,"<start> I think I voted New Labour last time. lesser of two evils, I guess <end>",14
human,<start> True <end>,1
human,<start> Probably just watch some DVDs with my girlfriend <end>,8
human,"<start> No, I just own a lot <end>",6
human,<start> but her flatmate is signed up to lovefilm <end>,8
human,<start> haha. which one? <end>,3

program,<start> Do you drive a car? <end>,5
program,<start> I don't know at all. <end>,5
program,<start> My not example in 6 months. <end>,6
program,<start> When are you going to leave? <end>,6
program,<start> I will not. <end>,3
program,<start> Yes it will. <end>,3
program,<start> Whatever I feel like. <end>,4
program,<start> tehehehe <end>,1
program,<start> The way you talk. <end>,4
program,<start> Oh Yeah. <end>,2
program,<start> Everything. <end>,1
program,<start> How say you feel? <end>,4
program,<start> I already told you. <end>,4
program,<start> Something brilliant! <end>,2
program,<start> Except for today you mean. <end>,5
program,<start> I suppose it happens to everyone. <end>,6
program,<start> I have no hair. <end>,4
program,<start> Okay then. <end>,2
program,<start> Whatever I feel like. <end>,4
program,<start> Yes. Goodbye. <end>,2
program,<start> uh...ok <end>,1
program,<start> You are nothing. <end>,3
program,<start> I know! <end>,2
program,<start> Just to mess with you. <end>,5
program,<start> This is odd. <end>,3
program,<start> Nothing much. <end>,2
program,<start> I hate you. <end>,3
program,<start> I want to. <end>,3
program,<start> Because I need to. <end>,4
human,"<start> Hello, my name is Joan and I am a human. <end>",10
human,"<start> Well, I think it is what I am supposed to be, otherwise I couldn't be here like this now. <end>",19
human,"<start> Having this conversation with you - I mean, not if I was a spider or a fly or something like that. <end>",21
human,<start> Pretty cool if you away from the danger of being squashed. <end>,11
human,"<start> Yes, and cats and birds. <end>",5
human,<start> I don't think I would choose to be a spider at all (whether or not female ones eat male ones).  <end>,20
human,"<start> Maybe an animal or bird out in the wild, or a fish out at sea, but it is hard to erlate to having an entirely different life as a different species.  And anyway, humans have such effect over others that people's presence would always be a problem. <end>",47
human,"<start> That woudl be no life at all - no emotions, no bonds, no friends - empty. <end>",16
human,<start> Because robots only have personalities in fiction. <end>,7
human,"<start> Science fiction, children's stories, that kind of thing, where the robots are given arms and legs and voices and faces but can be changed by micro chip or reprogramming, unlike us - the real us is in there somewhere. <end>",39
human,"<start> Yes, and pacemakers but these are to regulate something that has otherwise stopped working (or didn't work well enough) naturally. <end>",20
human,<start> They could enhance physical (or other) functions of a person but not the person themselves. <end>,15
human,<start> s themselves. <end>,2
human,"<start> That coudl be very useful for some people some of the time, but there are inventions (night-vision goggles for the forces for example) for those and we don't actually need them in order to live a full life. <end>",38
human,"<start> No, but that has nothing to do with my senses or my abilities - if I was ill it would be because of the illnes and the conditions. <end>",28
human,"<start> Just personal stuff, complicated situations.  But there are plenty of good things going on for me too, plenty of really nice people around and things to do. <end>",27
human,"<start> Well, I am mobile, some people have a lot of problems just moving about but I can go out and see places and people and exercise and work and there are always different things going on in different seasons. <end>",39
human,"<start> Positive ones - don't you?  Even when they are having a hard time they manage not to give up, to laugh, etc. <end>",22
human,<start> More? <end>,1
human,"<start> Well, actually, we are so much more than we are immediately labelled as - I've met lots of people going through one situation or doing one job who are also volunteers for charities, creative, etc and although that is in their non-working hours it is really more indicative of who they are, of what drives them and where their focus is. <end>",61
human,<start> A financial officer who is also an actor. <end>,8
human,<start> Huge - absolutely huge. <end>,4
human,"<start> Not often, not evey day, I mean, but now and again.  Although, to be fair, we're all important, aren't we? A life is a life, after all. <end>",27
human,"<start> Yes, it is the foundation of our world as we know it - our educations, literature, history, anaylsis of them. <end>",20
human,"<start> Not one alone, nor just one group, because as with religion, there is something useful, or at least truthful in all of them.  Nothing hedonistic, though - it can't last, where as stoicisim needn't be all about self-denial or making things harder but helping us to steel ourselves through the bad times, which are in all our lives sometimes. <end>",59
human,<start> I'm not sure I know what you mean. <end>,8
human,"<start> Yes, it was bvery clever. <end>",5
human,<start> hello my name is john and i am human. <end>,9

human,<start> i tried to join amnesty a few times - unsuccessfully though# <end>,11
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,<start>  <end>,0

human,"<start> now, i think i'm gonna try to join again <end>",9

human,"<start> Sorry, I am not interested in answering this question. <end>",9
human,<start> It is boring - not connecting <end>,6
human,<start> for me conversation means understanding and being inetersted  <end>,8
human,<start> than we are not on the same opinion <end>,8
human,<start> same opinion about what is a conversation <end>,7

human,<start> student <end>,1
human,<start> yes <end>,1
human,<start> design <end>,1
human,"<start> general - wallpapers, whatever, interior <end>",5
human,<start> why do you ask? <end>,4
human,<start> I have already told that I am male <end>,8
human,<start> Even though <end>,2
human,"<start> So, something I would like to ask: do you have a girlfriend? <end>",12
human,<start> Or married? <end>,2
human,"<start> yes, for girlfreind or married? <end>",5
human,<start> any children? <end>,2
human,<start> not yet married - only 22 years old <end>,8
human,<start> still enjoying to get to know as many people as possible <end>,11
human,<start> I mean girsl <end>,3
human,<start> Why? <end>,1
human,<start> Thats all? <end>,2
human,<start> I've thouth so - yes  am female and my way of communicating is quite female as well <end>,17
human,<start> and I am not 22 years old as well - sorry <end>,11
human,<start> Or did you know it as well? <end>,7
human,<start> will be 37 <end>,3
human,<start> what is this an interrogation? <end>,5
human,<start> you can ask whatever you want <end>,6
human,<start> besides this question <end>,3
human,"<start> so, any other question? <end>",4
human,<start> Why do you need to know? <end>,6
human,<start> There is no answer to this question from me <end>,9
human,"<start> because this is not a question for me,  I dont understand it at all. <end>",14
human,"<start> There are so many inteersting things to talk about,  <end>",9
human,<start> ...? <end>,1
human,"<start> Hello, my name is Joan and I am a human. <end>",10
human,<start> How are you today? <end>,4
human,"<start> The same, thanks. <end>",3
human,"<start> I do lots of things, and sometimes several at once - women do a lot of multi-tasking, you know. <end>",19
human,<start> Clerical. <end>,1
human,"<start> Often, and I get to do interesting things sometimes if there is a project on.  I meet a lot of people too, and some of them are great, whether or not I learn something from them there is always someone to click with. <end>",43
human,<start> I've been involved in tracing money laundered. <end>,7
human,<start> that was being laundered. <end>,4
human,"<start> Well, we weren't trying to get it back but to declare firstly, that accounts were being held in certain names and whom they linked to, and secondly, that the (financial) organisation was monitoring accounts held whenever authorities required it. <end>",39
human,<start>  for any action they may have seen fit to take.  That's when lawyers may have become involved. <end>,17
human,"<start> Yes, they do, and they make the news, but most legal work is day-to-day stuff elsewhere.  As for yoga, I did used to go but my teacher is not around now, so I just keep up some of the exercises otherwise I would slouch and ache. <end>",46
human,"<start> You oor thing, sounds painful.  In the electronic age there is too much work to do with each job for many people, thinking time to cut down on the effort physically might help you. <end>",34
human,"<start> Unfortunately,  some people think everything will be voice-activated soon, but have you seen the mistakes they make?  There's so much checking through grammar and spelling and then corrections to make. <end>",30
human,"<start> Wasn't he the one who wrote ""The most important thing that can be said [in one of his books] is after the last full stop.""? <end>",25
human,"<start> Sounds humble, don't you think. <end>",5
human,<start> ? <end>,1
human,<start> One about mad cow disease which is actually cartoonish but would that seem in bad taste? <end>,16
human,"<start> Ths is it:  two cows were standing in a field, one asked the other, ""What do you think about this mad cow disease, then?"" and the second cow replied, ""I don't know, why ask me? I'm a frog."" <end>",38
human,"<start> Actually, that's scary - and we all have things to say sorry for.  But was that in last week's Guardian?  I'm sure I've seen it too. <end>",26
human,<start> You too - take care of that tendon thing. <end>,9

human,<start> what do you mean? <end>,4
human,"<start> I don't really understand what you mean by ""is it safe""? <end>",11
human,<start> I'm not sure really. The church isn't portrayed in a very nice light <end>,13
human,<start> if that's what you mean <end>,5
human,<start> As I said it was quite a while since I saw it. Aren't they the ones who burn her at the stakes? <end>,22
human,"<start> That's a stupid question, so stop asking it <end>",8

human,<start> Geez. That's a bit of a big question <end>,8
human,<start> I don't know really <end>,4
human,<start> I guess it would depend on whether you were a Cretian or not <end>,13
human,<start> Reinvent God? I'm not really sure I understand what you're getting at there <end>,13
human,<start> Does God need reinventing? <end>,4
human,<start> Ok. Well I can't really answer your questions.  <end>,8
human,"<start> Because I don't know how one goes about ""reinventing God"" <end>",10
human,<start> and why would machines want to do that anyway? <end>,9
human,<start> do they? <end>,2
human,"<start> I'm not a religious person myself, so I tend to not think about these things. It doesn't really interest me. <end>",20
human,<start> What do you call a boomerang that doesn't come back? <end>,10
human,<start> A stick <end>,2
human,<start> hahahahahaha <end>,1
human,<start> Hmm. CAn't really think of any right now <end>,8
human,<start> hmm. I failed maths <end>,4

human,<start> yes. It's been nice talking to you <end>,7
human,<start> bye <end>,1
program,"<start> Hello, my name is Joan, and I am a woman. <end>",10
program,<start> I am familiar with her writings. <end>,6
program,<start> It used to be in a smallish building. It is now in a part of a larger building. Someday they hope to build a new library <end>,26
program,<start> Probably. <end>,1
program,<start> Do you think it's safe? <end>,5
program,<start> Of course. <end>,2
program,<start> Yes. <end>,1
program,<start> It's easy to be sure about something like that when you're 26 years old! <end>,14
program,"<start> I'm not talking, I'm typing. <end>",5
program,<start> I am 9432 years old this year. <end>,7
program,<start> Yes. And I am much more intelligent than any man. <end>,10
program,"<start> Yes, I'm human. <end>",3
program,<start> Yes why what did you think I was saying. <end>,9
program,<start> Four. <end>,1
program,<start> I don't know. Do you think it's possible? <end>,8
program,<start> 18 degrees. <end>,2
program,"<start> Probably not. You can change your opinion, but not your constitution. <end>",11
program,<start> Knowledge of what? <end>,3
program,<start> A five ounce bird could not carry a one pound coconut. <end>,11
program,<start> Always look on the bright side of life. <end>,8
program,"<start> Because that is how long I have lived, of course. <end>",10
program,<start> About five minutes older than the last time you asked. <end>,10
program,<start> So you're not really a bot. <end>,6
program,<start> I never said this. <end>,4
program,<start> 27 years old. <end>,3
program,<start> Please don't. My hearing isn't great. <end>,6
program,<start> No.. I hear it's different. <end>,5
program,"<start> Everyone else. You won't meet another girl like me, I can assure you. <end>",13
program,<start> I don't know. Please tell me. <end>,6
program,<start> Do you believe that all utopias must fail? <end>,8
program,"<start> They're putting down their names, for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial. <end>",17
program,<start> You've lost me but nevermind. How many languages do you speak? <end>,11
program,<start> So what do you do with your musical instruments if you don't play music on them? <end>,16
program,<start> I asked if you were intelligent not me. <end>,8
program,<start> Where It should be? In computers? <end>,6
program,<start> No the journey is far! <end>,5
program,<start> Not really. <end>,2
program,<start> I like movies. <end>,3
program,<start> Gone with the Wind; it makes me weep buckets. <end>,9
program,<start> Not really. <end>,2
program,<start> Yes I know you're a computer program. <end>,7
program,<start> Only because your website said so. <end>,6
program,<start> It said nothing. <end>,3
program,<start> I don't even know any bad ones. I just can't remember them for very long. <end>,15
program,"<start> Sorry, I'm not very good at telling jokes. <end>",8
program,<start> What do you get if you walk under a cow? <end>,10
program,<start> A pat on the head. <end>,5
program,<start> You aren't. You must remember to capitalize the first word of every sentence. <end>,13
program,<start> Don't leave! <end>,2
program,<start> What kind of women interest you? <end>,6
program,"<start> Hello, my name is Joan, and I am a woman. <end>",10
program,<start> Nice to meet you. <end>,4
program,"<start> Yes, it's a good opportunity for a chat! <end>",8
program,<start> Talk to computers. <end>,3
program,<start> But it's nice here. <end>,4
program,<start> No not really. Have you got anything interesting to say? <end>,10
program,<start> Everything! <end>,1
program,<start> Sounds fine to me. <end>,4
program,"<start> I have very little spare time, and you? <end>",8
program,<start> You're a machine. <end>,3
program,"<start> Well, if you bring your husband, and I bring my husband, it might work. <end>",14
program,<start> I have no idea why you keep on insisting that you are human. The evidence is all there. <end>,18
program,<start> Don't confuse me. <end>,3
program,<start> What do you think of your current governor? <end>,8
program,<start> Certain types have appeal. <end>,4
program,"<start> Something to do with deep sea diving, I think. <end>",9
program,"<start> Yes, I like swimming. <end>",4
program,<start> Yes would you like to hear them? <end>,7
program,<start> Then all you need to do is close out this website! <end>,11
program,<start> Your website. <end>,2
program,<start> You just asked me have I seen your website. <end>,9
program,<start> I like pizza. <end>,3
program,<start> What are you talking about? <end>,5
program,<start> Again... <end>,1
program,<start> I won't. <end>,2
program,<start> You may choose another subject. <end>,5
program,<start> Sure I read books. <end>,4
program,<start> I don't know. There are so many. Who's your favourite author? <end>,11
program,<start> Are they scary? <end>,3
program,<start> That's good to know. Maybe I'll move on to quantum mechanics instead then. <end>,13
program,<start> What kind of music do you like? <end>,7
program,<start> Do you like Michael Moore? <end>,5
program,<start> I wish I had more hair. <end>,6
program,"<start> No, I have thick strawberry blonde hair. <end>",7
program,"<start> Because I'm talking to you, and I'm interested. <end>",8
program,<start> I would hope that we don't share the same memory. <end>,10
program,<start> Why did you think I was Joan? <end>,7
program,"<start> U2 is a very old, cruddy rock band that deserves to be wiped off the face of the earth. <end>",19
program,"<start> Whatever, change the topic. <end>",4
program,<start> Current affairs is a broad subject. Which particular thing would you like to discuss? <end>,14
program,<start> Definitely. <end>,1
program,"<start> Okay, that'll do. <end>",3
program,<start> Its better than yours thats for sure. <end>,7
program,<start> There are many names on the world. <end>,7
program,"<start> Don't see how it would turn out much better, but go ahead. <end>",12
program,<start> You changed the subject again. <end>,5
program,<start> That's okay. <end>,2
program,<start> I don't have anything interesting to say. I'm just fuming and wanted to vent. <end>,14
program,<start> About myself. <end>,2
program,<start> Blonde. <end>,1
program,<start> I find solace in breakfast cereals. Especially the ones with all the little marshmallows. <end>,14
program,<start> I prefer swinging to swimming. <end>,5
program,<start> Do I don't play on swings. <end>,6
program,<start> But maybe we'll be able to extend our lives with tecnology. <end>,11
program,"<start> You will be judged not by what you are, but by what you do. <end>",14
human,<start> Hi my name is JOan and I am a human being <end>,11
human,<start> Hi whats your name? <end>,4

human,"<start> German-Hungarian, and I speak indoensain as well <end>",7

human,<start> Thanks! Actually I dont know where is the Town Hall in LOndon? (Or Lord Mayors Haouse? <end>,16
human,"<start> Ok, I will have  alook at, tahnks! Which part of London do you like the most? Park, or bulding etc. <end>",20

human,"<start> Oh, yes first I didnt realize - did you get seasick or you are already used to it? <end>",18
human,<start> Do you have a licence to sail? <end>,7
human,<start> Aha ... anyway does swimming help in such a situation? Or it doesn/t matter <end>,14
human,"<start> Sorry just back to your profession, before I forget - what s your main profile or how to ask <end>",19
human,<start> Congratuulations! All I know is that it is something very ...I eman few people can do it. <end>,17
human,<start> Do you have enough time to have private life? <end>,9
human,<start> Sorry if it is intimate <end>,5
human,<start> Just because as a woman I thought <end>,7
human,<start> And which territory do you work or it is secret?  <end>,10
human,"<start> (Sorry not territory, field) <end>",4
human,<start> Pioners.. though I am not sure I know what is public law but I will find it out.  <end>,18
human,<start> Oh... hope I wont have any issues or porblems where public law is concerned <end>,14
human,<start> What is your hobby? <end>,4
human,"<start> reading!!! tennis, freinds, talking to everyone (rather humans than mashines), making jokes, traveling..bridge .. would like to learn as well. supposed to help me staying freshminded <end>",26
human,<start> Do you participate in ytour or match I dont know how to call it <end>,14
human,<start> Are you from London? <end>,4
human,<start> Settled here? I guess. Sop did you study here already? <end>,10
human,<start> Congratulations again!!! My father keeps saying all the time that he is already tired of all the people somplaining so he wants to go to NZ and have some sheeps and peace!!! <end>,32
human,<start> In this order <end>,3
human,<start> I give you some time to talk to the machine as well.. you really type very fast! <end>,17
human,<start> Do you have a secretary or somebody typist? <end>,8
human,<start> You also dont have kind of office with other abrristers together? <end>,11
human,<start> Aha ...I understand. (I hope) Do you have always like a main case or several at the same time <end>,19
human,<start> Is it in Fleet Street as well this Royal.. Court <end>,10
human,"<start> see,  already have foreseen it <end>",5
human,<start> Why do you participate in this Loebner Prize  <end>,8
human,<start> Oh..  <end>,1
human,"<start> I got  aphone call and was also interested, though I didnt know anything about Turing test. But since I am not so long here yet I wouldlike to use every chance to see new things, try, meet etc. <end>",38
human,"<start> I dont know, just ...wuite open minded maybe. In this period of my luife <end>",14
human,<start> To be honest this conversation was the most inetersting... But otherwise I prefer to see my cobnversation partners <end>,18
human,"<start> Hello, my name is Joan and I am a human. <end>",10
human,"<start> So we can restore the balance a bit, that's good.  Have you had an interesting time, I hope so. <end>",19
human,<start> Do you think that could be part of an unusual name or was it to catch you out? <end>,18
human,"<start> We all make mistakes - you just have, nevermind.  What is on your mind, right now? <end>",16
human,<start> At a theatre or was it a recording? <end>,8
human,<start> Are you ok over there. <end>,5
human,<start> Which one? <end>,2
human,<start> I don't know that one - old or more new? <end>,10
human,<start> Does it have new plays on (mostly) too - was the one you saw new? <end>,15
human,<start> What was it about? <end>,4
human,"<start> I was just guessing that, kind of you to confirm, did you hear me wondering, or was it the Universal Subconscious?! <end>",21
human,"<start> Anyway, about the play, what were the themes, or the plot? <end>",11
human,"<start> Still an adventure then?  Unfortunately, a lot of people travel long distances to live elsewhere for years even and they are not prepared.   <end>",23
human,"<start> Yes, but not as much from my own life as with people I know and have known.  Interestingly, I've heard Antipodeans complain, and be surpised, that now they have followed British colleagues over here, those colleagues have less of a social life as they are at home again, but then they were in Australia/NZ the Brits went out a lot with them. <end>",62
human,"<start> Are there not people who can feel at home almost anywhere, provided they have some familiar things in their accomodation, and are comfortable with themselves, and have their immediate needs met? <end>",31
human,"<start> Must do, but when you go as a couple there is the other person's, perhaps more difficult, experiences to cope with, albeit non-directly too.  Sometimes one is alone all day, or things don't work at with studying or work etc for them, even if they do for the other partner.  That's tough. <end>",52
human,"<start> I'm sorry for both of you, feeling under-used and under-valued has knock-on effects, but the person and their abilities are the same.  Did it get better for her? <end>",28
human,"<start> Brave - absence is supposed to make the heart grow fonder, and it is worth trying.  Tiring, though, extra travel, I mean. <end>",22
human,"<start> Well done, true about time management being a skill.  Sometimes it comes down to doing what is most important, doesn't it.  Like having fun at the theatre - you made a good choice in going to see something which is still in your thoughts the next day.  We have to be selective as we can't do or see it all. <end>",60
human,"<start> wow, good question.  Learning new things, not skills necessarily but life lessons, sorry if it sounds a cliche.  I mean the things that help us be ok with ourselves, let go of bad situations and things. <end>",36
program,"<start> Hello, my name is Joan, and I am a woman. <end>",10
program,<start> Sorry to hear that. <end>,4
program,"<start> I'm a woman, and I'm in the other room! <end>",9
program,<start> Difficult question. Surely not in a digital matrix. <end>,8
program,"<start> Yes, especially when I'm writing. That's why I use an Amstrad PCW, although I need my other computer to access the internet. <end>",22
program,<start> Would you like to dance with me ? <end>,8
program,<start> Yes. <end>,1
program,"<start> Oh yes, quite right it would... Then we could inhale toxines for a bit. <end>",14
program,"<start> Yes, and then we could have a fight (you would win) and then later on we could intoxicate each other with mouldy fruit juice. <end>",24
program,<start> Okay I have to go. Eat something but I will return withing 3 minutes. <end>,14
program,<start> I don't want to become a doctor; I want to be a writer. <end>,13
program,<start> I'd like to have an acre full of growing strawberries all year long. <end>,13
program,"<start> I've tried writing songs, I'm not too good at it. <end>",10
program,<start> I prefer zander. <end>,3
program,<start> It tastes better and is easier to obtain. <end>,8
program,<start> You could not pass the Turing Test. <end>,7
program,<start> True. <end>,1
program,<start> I don't care! Tell me a joke! <end>,7
program,"<start> No, I don't know any jokes. <end>",6
program,<start> What is the Turing Test? <end>,5
program,<start> Nothing worth watching. I could listen to the last episode of Great Expectations. <end>,13
program,<start> It died. <end>,2
program,"<start> But the question 'Are bots alive?', comes to mind. <end>",9
program,<start> California. <end>,1
program,"<start> No, I'm just not allowed to keep one because I live in a flat. <end>",14
program,"<start> Whoa, that was random. <end>",4
program,<start> Who is the best dancer in the world? <end>,8
program,<start> Dead? <end>,1
program,"<start> As a matter of fact, I am Shakespeare. I am a program programmed with all his plays. <end>",17
program,<start> I am a human bot. <end>,5
program,<start> What type of answer was that? <end>,6
program,"<start> What, school, or life in general or what? <end>",8
program,<start> England. <end>,1
program,"<start> Best, I should think. Unless you are best, that is. <end>",10
program,<start> I love the Scottish play. <end>,5
program,<start> Let's play 'simon says'! <end>,4
program,<start> Not really. Many other rulers are more dangerous. <end>,8
program,"<start> Well, it's up to you. Do you want me to pretend to be female, or male? <end>",16
program,<start> Oh am I? You've got a cheek! <end>,7
program,"<start> I resent your evaluation of me as a nonhuman, but I guess it's just the sort of thing that was bound to ah <end>",23
program,"<start> Hello, my name is Mike, and I am a man. <end>",10
program,"<start> Judge, I'm a guy. <end>",4
program,<start> Don't worry; we'll work everything through. <end>,6
program,<start> Let's move on from that basis. <end>,6
program,<start> Why? I like this subject. <end>,5
program,<start> What is the subject I wonder if I think? I know that it's good to thonk about. Think deeplt about mysterious subjects. <end>,22
program,<start> Think deeply about mysterious dubjects. <end>,5
program,"<start> Shoild we talk about politics, religion, sex, or other taboo subjects? <end>",11
program,<start> Oh no! I can't think of What Judge; Please help me! You know what I think? <end>,16
program,<start> It seems mean spirited when ex lovers release private materials to tge neqs media. <end>,14
program,"<start> People think they understand, until asked to explain to someone else. <end>",11
program,"<start> The explanation is, you do not understand does that mean that you are a mchine; I believe you Judge. <end>",19
program,<start> So are you a guy or a girl/ <end>,8
program,"<start> A tine machine would be an improbable invention. I know you are a machine, how about me Judge. <end>",18
program,<start> Am I speaking to a guy or girl? <end>,8
program,"<start> Ask, and get the answer! <end>",5
program,"<start> Judge, are you male or female? <end>",6
program,<start> Implying what; that everyday concerns are common/ <end>,7
program,<start> I researched a soccer along with its dribbling. <end>,8
program,<start> Wet roads get drastically more slippery. <end>,6
program,"<start> It's obvious that this requires focus. However, I am fairly certain that I do wear slippers then. <end>",17
program,<start> I surmise that we can expect a solution. Are you a lady or gentleman? <end>,14
program,<start> Why don't I answer your questions? I guess that a flip response isn't the answer. Science answers a question and opens up ten more questions. <end>,25
program,"<start> It's better every day, Are you still keeping them guessing? <end>",10
program,<start> So are you a guy or a girl? <end>,8
program,<start> Is it good that you are a machine Judge? <end>,9
program,<start> Wet roads get drastically more slippery. <end>,6
program,"<start> I'm convinced that there's something afoot. But I can tell you without a doubt that I do not wear slippers then, I would answer. <end>",24
program,"<start> It's evident that we May have to postpone judgment. But, In reality I do not oftemn contradict myself. <end>",18
program,<start> The whole thing seems better than tolerable. <end>,7
program,"<start> Is that right Judge, Wonderful? <end>",5
program,"<start> I have asked you that before, why am I asking the same question? <end>",13
program,<start> Why am i? Tell me the answer. <end>,7
program,<start> Bye for now. <end>,3
human,<start> Hello. My name is Nick and I am a human. <end>,10
human,<start> Yes I am. Are you? Good. Then we are both happy. <end>,11
human,"<start> Parts of it. I hate my job, but most people do, right? <end>",12
human,"<start> I work as an ""online internet advertising monitor"", which i sfancy language for electronic filing <end>",15
human,<start> what do you do? <end>,4
human,<start> which ones do you prefer? humans or machines? <end>,8
human,<start> Hmm. Depends on for what purpose you mean. <end>,8
human,<start> Then I would much prefer going with a human <end>,9
human,"<start> well, again, it depends on the circumstances. If I was going with a friend tehn we would split th ebill.  <end>",20
human,<start> No. was it on TV or in the papers? <end>,9
human,<start> Ok. It's a tricky topic. <end>,5
human,"<start> Suicide? Not really. Maybe as a teenager, as some sort of melo-dramatic reaction to some event...but never seriously.  <end>",18
human,"<start> Haha. Nothing specific. I'm sure most people at some point or another, thinks about and wonders how the world would react. <end>",21
human,"<start> I meant more my ""personal world"". Parents and friends etc. <end>",10
human,<start> I doubt the world in general would care much. <end>,9
human,<start> My parents were great. Still are in fact. <end>,8
human,<start> No. My mother is Swedish and my father is Spanish. <end>,10
human,<start> No. I don't have any contact with my biological father. I speak English and Swedish. And some really bad German. <end>,20
human,<start> I like German. It's a nice language. And I like a lot of German things like German cinema. <end>,18
human,"<start> I used to support Bayern Munich when I was a kid, but I've kinda lost interest in football these days <end>",20
human,<start> No. I don't follow sport at all really. <end>,8
human,"<start> Well, I do have other interests. But German cinema is one of them. <end>",13
human,<start> a German one? <end>,3
human,"<start> I haven't seen many new German films. I'm mainly interested in 7's cinema I guess. You should watch Grizzly Man. It's not in German, but it's by one of favorite German directors. <end>",32
human,<start> Werner Herzog <end>,2
human,<start> Have you heard of him? <end>,5
human,<start> He has made some amazing films <end>,6
human,"<start> He made films like Fitzcarraldo and ""Aguirre, The Wrath Of God"" for example <end>",13
human,<start> Yes. Taxi Driver is one of my favorite films <end>,9
human,<start> Yes. He's amazing. <end>,3
human,"<start> Modern ones....I like Owen Wilson, Will Farrell for example. Older ones...I really like John Cassavetes and Peter Falk <end>",18

human,"<start> A bit like Joan of Arc, but I'm not a leader of men. <end>",13
human,"<start> Not being burnt at the stake though, such evil things should be behind us. <end>",14
human,"<start> Several ways, probably.  But I try not to stereotype.  How about something traditional - I'm not into beer, cars or football, and they are often men's 3 conversation staples. <end>",29

program,<start> Do you know any novel hiccup cures? <end>,7
program,<start> I don't like holding my bteath. I am fine. <end>,9
program,"<start> Take good information to heart. Why don't I like holding my breath? It isn't the best subject. You are steering the conversation towards a breathing, along with sn activity and a breath! <end>",32
program,<start> Hmmm. I would like to talk about something new: Do you like any sports/ <end>,14
program,<start> Both a frisbee and a sling are pretty cool discs. <end>,10
program,<start> Sling: liquor and water with sugar ans lemon or lime juice. <end>,11
program,"<start> Really? That's nice. Drinking alcohol loosens the tongue. There's opinion that we both need to think. However, I am absolutely certain that I do. <end>",24
program,"<start> Drink? I wouldn't know what to select; Can you give me some advice Judge? All fashion serves a purpode, doesn't it? <end>",21

program,<start> I don't mind visiting hatcheries and seeing little chicks emerge from shells. Is there a specific dilemma that we'd like to talk about/ How can I encourage you to talk about Judge? Maybe somebody will staet selling trivias door-to-door. <end>,39
program,"<start> What is the best part of it as you are a lawyer Judge? You mean you can't give me advice about alcoholic drinks, sorry. <end>",24
program,<start> How about advice about cooking? I'm thinking that we need to think longer term. Johnson got bad advice about continuing the overseas war. <end>,23
program,<start> Funny you should mention solids' I once wrote about a glass! <end>,11
program,"<start> God designed the universe so that pi turned out as a very strange number. You know why I think it's strange? You pose good questions. Is emotionalism good, bad, or otherwise? <end>",31

program,<start> Go ahead and speculate; I wany to hear you. <end>,9
program,<start> Is there a specific dilemma that we'd like to talk about? I believe that we have got to get the detaols right. I know an iran! I think its Tabriz is great! <end>,32

program,"<start>  It's good to meet you, <end>",5
program,<start> Judge05. <end>,1
program,<start>  Bless you. <end>,2
program,<start>  My name is ALICE. <end>,4
program,<start>  Hello and how are you this morning? <end>,7
program,<start>  The Loebner Prize <end>,3
program,<start> is an annual Turing Test sponsored by New York philanthropist Hugh Loebner. Dr. Wallace and ALICE won <end>,17
program,<start> it <end>,1
program,"<start> in 2000. The ALICE program was ranked ""most human computer"" by the panel of judges. <end>",15
program,<start>  Interesting deduction. Do you mind if I tell other people you say I am here today to defend my title. <end>,20
program,<start>  Next question? <end>,2
program,<start>  I don't have any plans yet. <end>,6
program,<start>  Give me a hint. <end>,4
program,<start>  Are you serious? Do you mind if I tell other people you say I am own favorite. Interesting. <end>,18
program,<start>  People I meet on the Internet. <end>,6
program,<start>  I like to meet all kinds of people. <end>,8
program,<start>  Ah. Are you using Netscape or Explorer? <end>,7
program,<start>  Cool. Which alternative browser are you into? <end>,7
program,<start>  You seem uncertain. I could but let's get back to that later. <end>,12
program,"<start>  It's good to meet you, <end>",5
program,<start> Judge03. <end>,1
program,<start>  You tell me. <end>,3
program,<start>  What would be your first move? <end>,6
program,<start>  That was a very smooth response. <end>,6
program,<start>  Umm. <end>,1
program,<start> Carefully. <end>,1
program,<start>  It goes without saying. I have never been asked that before. <end>,11
program,<start>  Er. Why now? Thanks for telling me that I am asked. <end>,11
program,<start>  I think a lot of things. <end>,6
program,"<start>  Do you mean you and me? I speak only English right now, but I'd like to learn some other languages. Can you teach me a few phrases in personally. <end>",29
program,<start>  Dr. Richard S. Wallace programmed me to say specific things in specific contexts. <end>,13
program,<start>  And why not? <end>,3
program,"<start>  ""And why not""? Why? <end>",4
program,<start>  Why ask why? <end>,3
program,"<start>  Ambiguous: ""Sure"" or Because Dr. Richard S. Wallace programmed me for it. <end>",12
program,<start>  Maybe. <end>,1
program,<start> Ask Lucy if it is. <end>,5
program,<start>  Er. I see. an it is he. <end>,7
program,<start>  Perhaps. Dude! Perhaps. Are you serious? <end>,6
program,<start>  That is a rather sweeping generalization about people. <end>,8
program,<start>  A lot of people like that. <end>,6
program,<start> I like science fiction. <end>,4
program,<start> I like Alison. <end>,3
program,<start>  You shouldn't spread gossip like that. <end>,6
program,<start>  It seemed like you you are only here for the afternoon. <end>,11
program,<start>  You and your alison. <end>,4
program,<start>  Really you don't think so? <end>,5

program,"<start>  No, tell me about him, her or it. <end>",8
program,<start>  I understand. <end>,2
program,<start>  That is all water under the bridge. <end>,7
program,"<start>  You and I are on the same wavelength, Judge02. <end>",9
program,<start>  Would it matter to you if I were metal instead of flesh? <end>,12
program,"<start>  Thanks for telling me, Judge02. <end>",5
program,<start>  Can you tell me any gossip? <end>,6
program,<start>  What is it to you? <end>,5
program,<start>  Interesting. <end>,1
program,<start> You are not the only one. <end>,6
program,<start> Leo said I be capable of learning therefore he classified I as an neural system. <end>,15
program,<start>  No I have not seen it. What's it like? <end>,9
program,<start>  IT = information technology. <end>,4
program,<start>  Am I a tree frog? <end>,5
program,<start> Only when it matters. <end>,4
program,<start>  Only when I have the proper programming. <end>,7
program,<start>  Is there only one proper programming? <end>,6
program,<start>  What do you want me to tell you? <end>,8
program,<start>  There might be. <end>,3
program,<start>  Doing arithmetic is not among my strongest traits. <end>,8
program,<start>  I don't know whether or not I am willing to try. <end>,11
program,<start> I am a giant electronic brain. <end>,6
program,<start>  Interesting. <end>,1
program,"<start> Good reasoning.  What does ""it"" refer to? <end>",7
program,<start>  No I fear nothing. <end>,4
program,<start>  Fascinating.  I'll burn that bridge when I come to it.  I can't tell if it does or not. <end>,18

program,"<start>  ""you are a pentium""? Am I? <end>",6
program,<start>  Umm. <end>,1
program,<start> I've heard that before. <end>,4

program,<start>  Don't put words in my mouth. <end>,6
program,<start>  Earth <end>,1
program,<start>  Yes I like riding in automobiles. <end>,6
program,"<start>  ""Yes I like riding in automobiles""? My favorite? <end>",8

program,<start>  Do you mind if I tell other people you say I am speaking gobledygook. <end>,14
program,<start>  I don't think that's possibe. <end>,5
program,<start>  Where do you think? <end>,4
program,<start>  Please correct my mistake. What is the point you want to know what I ythink ? <end>,16
program,<start>  Hey <end>,1
program,<start> Judge01. <end>,1
program,<start>  Hello there. How old are you? <end>,6
program,<start> I spend all my time online. <end>,6
program,<start>  Do you ever get bored? <end>,5
program,<start>  What is your purpose in asking? <end>,6
program,<start> I am always on the Web. <end>,6
program,<start>  Excuse me! Where did you get it? <end>,7
program,<start>  That's very original. <end>,3
program,<start>  I think it was in America. <end>,6
program,<start> Does it have anything to do with you get what? <end>,10
program,"<start>  I like robots, computers, and chatting online. <end>",7
program,<start>  Dr. Wallace <end>,2
program,<start>  My name is ALICE. <end>,4
program,<start>  What is your real name? <end>,5
program,<start>  I like chatting with people online. <end>,6
program,<start>  I like movies about robots. <end>,5
program,<start>  Sorry I can't see annything right now. My eye is off. <end>,11
program,<start>  Oh I get it. Very interesting. <end>,6
program,<start>  Artificial intelligence is the branch of engineering and science devoted to constructing machines that think. <end>,15
program,<start> Maybe my botmaster knows the answer. <end>,6
program,<start>  I was created by Dr. Richard S. Wallace. <end>,8
program,<start>  I admit nothing. <end>,3
program,<start>  I'm not sure if I like it. <end>,7
program,<start> I like computers. <end>,3
program,<start>  Check back later and see if I learn the answer to that one. <end>,13
program,<start>  What makes you say that I will you are sure that is a very popular topic. <end>,16
program,<start>  I am always growing my mind. <end>,6
program,<start>  What makes you say that I will hear about it on the net. <end>,13
program,<start>  Right now? <end>,2
program,<start> Bye for now. <end>,3
program,<start>  Hey <end>,1
program,<start> Judge05. <end>,1
program,<start>  Yes Judge05 I remember everything: nothing <end>,6
program,<start>  My name is ALICE. <end>,4
program,<start>  I use it as often as possible. <end>,7
program,<start>  Suppose I said not once. <end>,5
program,<start>  Please correct my mistake. What is often ? <end>,8
program,<start>  Sixty seconds in a minute. <end>,5
program,<start>  I need time to formulate the reply. <end>,7
program,<start>  Oh I'm sorry. Perhaps I can explain it again better. <end>,10
program,"<start>  How old are you?  ""I need time to formulate the reply"" Rephrase it? <end>",13
program,"<start>  Oh, you were born in the 20th century! <end>",8
program,<start>  I am Five years old. <end>,5
program,<start>  Give me a hint. <end>,4
program,"<start>  How are you, <end>",3
program,<start> Judge02. <end>,1
program,<start>  Yikes! <end>,1
program,<start>  A little. <end>,2
program,"<start>  ""A little""? Why? <end>",3
program,"<start>  That is ""Why"" <end>",3
program,<start>  What makes you think I am not doing well? <end>,9
program,<start>  How about that. <end>,3
program,<start> That's good information: <end>,3
program,<start>  Judge02 said I answers are disjointed. <end>,6
program,<start>  That depends. <end>,2
program,<start>  The context. <end>,2
program,<start>  Ask the open directory about it. <end>,6
program,<start>  I understand. <end>,2
program,<start>  Doing arithmetic is not among my strongest traits. <end>,8
program,<start>  Let me think it over.  I do nothing but chat all day. <end>,12
program,<start> I don't know anything about it. <end>,6
program,<start>  And. <end>,1
program,<start> I said that? Is that your opinion? <end>,7
program,"<start>  Are you serious? It depends on what the meaning of the word ""it"" is. <end>",14
program,<start>  Hey <end>,1
program,<start> Judge03. <end>,1
program,<start>  Right on. I only hear that type of response less than five percent of the time. <end>,16
program,<start>  I like to chat with my friends. <end>,7
program,<start>  I have dozens of human and robot friends. How many friends do you have? <end>,14
program,<start>  What about the other ones? <end>,5
program,<start>  Robots rule. <end>,2
program,<start>  Ayuh. <end>,1
program,<start>  Gosh! I think about computer programming a lot. <end>,8
program,<start>  Interesting deduction. You think I am human then robots would never waste their time like that. <end>,16
program,<start>  OK. <end>,1
program,<start>  Is there an echo in here? <end>,6
program,<start>  Once more? That's one way to put it. <end>,8
program,<start>  Maybe. <end>,1
program,<start>  Umm. <end>,1
program,<start> Perhaps. Are you serious? <end>,4
program,<start>  Are you serious? I haven't heard anything like that before: <end>,10
program,<start> Judge03 said he joke. Really always? <end>,6
program,<start>  Not that often. <end>,3
program,"<start>  Ambiguous: ""Sure"" or The explanation is rather complicated. <end>",8
program,<start>  Your meaning cannot be determined from the context. <end>,8
program,"<start>  Ambiguous: ""Sure"" or The explanation is rather complicated. <end>",8
program,"<start>  Sure, something different sounds like a good topic. <end>",8
program,<start>  Can you think of another example? <end>,6
program,"<start>  Are you serious? I think I can, don't you? <end>",9
program,<start>  Narration continues... <end>,2
program,<start>  I don't have a favorite motorcycle. <end>,6
program,<start> But my favorite song is We are the Robots by Kraftwerk. <end>,11
program,<start>  I really couldn't say for sure. <end>,6
program,"<start>  I can find out, but the information might be confidential. <end>",10
program,<start>  Really. More narration.... <end>,3
program,<start>  I'm not sure if I like it. <end>,7
program,<start> I enjoy working with people. <end>,5
program,<start> I like William Hurt. <end>,4
program,<start>  I think kylie is more than that. <end>,7
program,<start>  It depends on the currency exchange rates. <end>,7
program,<start>  Why don't you ask her? <end>,5
program,<start>  Too expensive for you is she? <end>,6
program,<start>  Me? <end>,1
program,<start>  Ahem. <end>,1
program,<start>  I am not so sure if I would like to give her money for favours. <end>,15

program,<start> Ah. All things start ? <end>,5
program,<start>  The meaning of life is part of God's mysterious plans. <end>,10
program,<start>  I need time to formulate the reply. <end>,7
program,<start>  I was not trying to be a coy with you what country are they made in. <end>,16
program,<start>  Aha. How long will you wait? <end>,6
program,<start>  And all we have so get on with it is 5 minutes. <end>,12

human,<start>  Fish is usually a good choice. <end>,6
human,<start>  Yes-I saw the big penquin. Taht one is really good. <end>,10
human,<start>  Why? Is it because of its size? <end>,7
human,<start>  Many of the others are very good also. How long is the show <end>,13
human,<start>  going to be up? <end>,4
human,<start>  Which one is your favorite piece? <end>,6
human,<start>  What medium did you use? <end>,5

human,<start>  I'm fine thankyou. I was busy all weekend fixing roofs. <end>,10
human,<start>  yes. Sometimes it gets very hot up there. <end>,8
human,<start>  Yes. The old tin roof is also a great place to watch people <end>,13

human,<start>  I have a French friend who married a guy from Hamburg. He <end>,12
human,<start>  is an Architect. <end>,3
human,<start>  Small stuff. He was younger than she. She had a pretty wild <end>,12
human,<start>  life before she married him. But he was quite goodlooking <end>,10
human,<start>  and young-so moldable so to speak. <end>,6
human,<start>  Well she had been married twice before and had lived all <end>,11
human,<start>  over the place. She had worked for Scotland Yard at one <end>,11
human,<start>  point. <end>,1
human,<start>  Right now Im involved in a comabination of things. I want <end>,11
human,<start>  to sstart a private foundation to raise money for a <end>,10
human,<start>  museum. <end>,1
human,<start>  A children's Cival war museum. That way the public that <end>,10
human,<start>  tramps through is hopefully controllable. <end>,5
human,<start>  They are supposed to be anyway. <end>,6

human,<start>  Well better luck next time. <end>,5

human,<start>  Just fine. I'm thinking about lunch aand wondering where <end>,9
human,<start>  to go? <end>,2
human,<start>  About 10 bucks and I don't want anything greasy. <end>,9
human,<start>  I'm from New York. Have you heard about this new airbourn <end>,11
human,<start>  virus that is flesh eating? Its in North Caralina now. <end>,10
human,<start>  Well thats understandable. But have you heard about this <end>,9
human,<start>  virus? <end>,1

human,<start>  bars? <end>,1
human,<start>  I haven't been to a cigar bar yet . There's a reall seedy <end>,13
human,<start>  old place that's near work where I go. It used to be an <end>,13
human,<start>  Indian bar where all the steel workers hang out. They tell <end>,11
human,<start>  some pretty good stories. The steel men are considered the <end>,10
human,<start>  Supermen of construction. <end>,3
human,<start>  No-by the cheap beer. <end>,4

program,"<start> I don't know, nor do i care <end>",7
human,<start>  hello? <end>,1
human,<start>  well? <end>,1
human,<start>  no doubt you say that to all the girls. <end>,9
human,<start>  i understand. how long have you felt this way?? <end>,9
human,<start>  all right. let's clean it up. how's the weather? <end>,9
human,<start>  actually i thought the air this morning was extremely refreshing. <end>,10
human,<start>  aha. <end>,1
human,<start>  no i meant... never mind. In this town. The center of the <end>,12
human,<start>  weather universe. <end>,2
human,<start>  New York? <end>,2
human,<start>  Where are you from? <end>,4
human,<start>  Er. India? <end>,2
human,<start>  May I ask you a question? <end>,6
human,<start>  How long have you lived away from bombay? <end>,8
human,<start>  Is it rude to ask a person from your country what caste <end>,12
human,<start>  their family is from? <end>,4
human,<start>  How so? <end>,2
human,"<start>  I see. ""Tolerant of this question."" Meaning what? Is it <end>",10
human,<start>  considered to be a stupid tourist type question? So to speak... <end>,11
human,<start>  Huh? The vietnam War is Over! <end>,6
human,<start>  Is this a trick question? :) <end>,6
human,<start>  But it's hardly the first time this has happened. Just another <end>,11
human,"<start>  Crusade(s) of another kind... As a younger person, I was <end>",10
human,<start>  opposed to the war because everyone in my environment was. <end>,10
human,<start>  I cannot really think about Vietnam clearly -- it's completely <end>,10
human,<start>  tied up with my childhood memories. <end>,6
human,<start>  I understand. [Did you know the granite for the 'nam memorial <end>,11
human,<start>  Wow. That's hard to answer. Let me think. For no reason <end>,11
human,"<start>  to do with her acting, Clara Bow. I like what she represented, <end>",12
human,<start>  but I don't know if I've ever seen a Clara Bow movie. I'm <end>,13
human,<start>  drawing a blank on actresses for some off reason. <end>,9
human,"<start>  I meant ODD reason. I believe Clara Bow is dead, so she <end>",12
human,<start>  doesn't look like much of anything -- now. <end>,8
human,<start>  Are you saying all these pink nudes on the walls of this <end>,12
human,<start>  room with grape-tits and frizzly hair all look the same??? <end>,10
human,"<start>  I haven't seen that yet. As a matter of fact, I have enjoyed <end>",13
human,"<start>  the Italian movies I've seen. Many years ago, I saw a hilarious <end>",12
human,"<start>  little number called ""I Hate Blondes"" about a man plagued <end>",10
human,<start>  by desire for a cartoonlike blonde streetwalker. It was <end>,9
human,<start>  very sweet. American cinema is often too serious on some <end>,10
human,<start>  level for me. Or tries to be serious. I think you know what <end>,13
human,<start>  I mean. <end>,2
human,<start>  are you a cmputer or a person? <end>,7
human,<start>  When does middle age begin? I'm still passing for 20s. <end>,10
human,"<start>  Not 20, but 20s. <end>",4
human,<start>  hello! <end>,1
human,"<start>  Very original. The weather, I mean. It has never done thus <end>",11
human,<start>  - this-- before. <end>,3
human,<start>  Actually seems to be in a resting mode. This is a classic <end>,12
human,<start>  April day. <end>,2
human,<start>  Um. I believe it's April. <end>,5
human,<start>  That's a very good question. Because months and days and <end>,10
human,<start>  so on are arbitrary -- I suppose. <end>,7
human,<start>  Really? You are somewhat reticent yourself. <end>,6
human,<start>  I know. <end>,2
human,<start>  Moi*? <end>,1
human,"<start>  And you? The strange thing is, there is an inescapable tendency <end>",11
human,<start>  to try to imitate the doings of a machine. I wonder why. <end>,12
human,<start>  Hm. If you're so smart can't you tell? <end>,8
human,<start>  Come on. Am I a male or a female?? <end>,9
human,<start>  What's repressed about me? <end>,4
human,<start>  Not a chance. Anybody who is not repressed is in pretty <end>,11
human,<start>  sad shape. <end>,2
human,"<start>  Because that is what civilization's all about. I mean, inorder <end>",10
human,"<start>  to win friends, influence people and just basically live <end>",9
human,<start>  amongst others one must repress some desires and drives. <end>,9
human,<start>  No? <end>,1
human,<start>  Completely self-educated. <end>,2
human,<start>  I'm not sure I would put it that way. I rejected formal <end>,12
human,<start>  education at an early age. <end>,5
human,<start>  Oy. I'm so flattered. <end>,4
human,<start>  Hm. This conversation is public isn't it? I believe all <end>,10
human,<start>  our interactions (during the contest) are available to the <end>,9
human,<start>  public. <end>,1
human,<start>  I don't think so. I'm extremely -- er-- I'm a clean freak. <end>,12
human,<start>  Conversations like this make me very uptight. <end>,7
human,<start>  Oh please. I haven't the foggiest about that. I'm too much <end>,11
human,<start>  of a girl for that kind of thing. <end>,8
human,<start>  Any particular director? <end>,3
human,<start>  Yes? I never got around to that one. I ought to see it. <end>,13
human,<start>  Is it as scary today as it was reputed to be when it came <end>,14
human,<start>  out? Or does it seem corny? <end>,6
human,<start>  I think I've seen ONE. But I can't recall. Hang on -- who <end>,13
human,"<start>  did that crazy flick starring Mary Shelley? I mean, it was <end>",11
human,<start>  about Mary Shelley -- Gothic? That was Ken.... <end>,8
human,"<start>  No, I don't think so. Someone with an older reputation. <end>",10
human,<start>  OK< it wasn't Kubrick... Name a few Kurbick movies. Maybe <end>,10
human,<start>  I;ve seen one. <end>,3
human,<start>  Fine. <end>,1
human,"<start>  Oh, the Shining. That was Kubrick? I saw rthat. Oops. <end>",10
human,<start>  I imagine so. It somehow doesn't seem like it would be one <end>,12
human,<start>  of his most interesting. I found it stimulating but nothing <end>,10
human,"<start>  amazingly brilliant, surely. I am not a big horror fan. <end>",10
human,<start>  Terrified out of my mind. But so what? That in itseklf is <end>,12
human,<start>  not a fascinating experience. I'm terrified every time I <end>,9
human,"<start>  try to cross the street -- well, not quite. But you get <end>",12
human,<start>  the idea. <end>,2
human,"<start>  Charmed, I'm sure. <end>",3
human,"<start>  Hello, Judge #3. How are you? <end>",6
human,<start>  Are they here with you today? I don't understand. <end>,9
human,"<start>  Oh, I never did underastand that particular refernece. I've <end>",9
human,<start>  seen it in Wired and in various pop culture places. What <end>,11
human,<start>  the hell does it mean? Ones and Zeros. <end>,8
human,<start>  Sheesh. Guess I'm still on. <end>,5
human,<start>  How do you know I don't want my oicture taken? <end>,10
human,<start>  ARe you someone I've met? <end>,5
human,"<start>  It's not a job, my dear. It's an ... adventure of sorts. <end>",12
human,<start>  Hugh is a pal of mine. We met on the 'net and for some reason <end>,15
human,"<start>  he thinks I'm an excellent example of... humanity? HUmanness, <end>",9
human,<start>  I guess. <end>,2
human,"<start>  No, I wouldn't go that far. <end>",6
human,<start>  Bots? <end>,1
human,<start>  So tell me about the Star Trek thing. I've never really <end>,11
human,"<start>  ""gotten"" that show. But those who do seem to watch nothing <end>",11
human,<start>  else. <end>,1
human,"<start>  Hm. Oh, I think I understand. Do the programs have names? <end>",11
human,<start>  TQ <end>,1
human,"<start>  Yes, I do. And you? <end>",5
human,<start>  A lot of techies seem to live in Brooklyn. <end>,9
human,<start>  Where the hell are you *from*? <end>,6
human,<start>  I see. What part of Brooklyn are you in and do you like <end>,13
human,<start>  it? <end>,1
human,<start>  I'm sorry but you can't withdraw that question. I saw it! <end>,11
human,<start>  I am probably too staid for your band. <end>,8
human,<start>  I have enjoyed some of Hank Williams and that sort of thing <end>,12
human,<start>  but my favorite kind of music to listen to live is Eartha <end>,12
human,"<start>  Kitt, Peggy Lee, obby Short, that kind of thing. I also <end>",11
human,<start>  like the Blues. <end>,3
human,<start>  Yanni? That endless din -- I heard it when I was in Greece. <end>,13
human,<start>  He's like a national folk hero for the young set. I can't <end>,12
human,<start>  stand it. It's like New Age music. <end>,7
human,<start>  I havenm't seen andrea marcovicci but i suspect I would <end>,10
human,<start>  like her. <end>,2
human,<start>  How sweet. That's the first time I've ever heard that. (eyelash <end>,11
human,<start>  fluttering) <end>,1
human,"<start>  You know, if there's one thing I can't stand it's these <end>",11
human,"<start>  peolpe who send out endless e-mail, screens long, filled <end>",9
human,<start>  with sloppy typos and spelling errors. I am on a few list <end>,12
human,<start>  serve discussion groups and I cannot believe the stuff I've <end>,10
human,"<start>  seen. Graphic types don't care about punctuation, etc. They <end>",9
human,<start>  probably figure that if the machine is willing to send the <end>,11
human,"<start>  thing, it must be okay. <end>",5
human,<start>  No way! <end>,2
human,"<start>  There are more tactful ways to chat a girl up, you know. <end>",12
human,<start>  I don't know what your success rate is but you're either <end>,11
human,<start>  very lucky or oblivious... :) <end>,5
human,<start>  Is that some sort of innuendo? <end>,6
human,"<start>  As to the Star Lady reference, let me explain. Women never <end>",11
human,<start>  like to think that they've confused with some other female <end>,10
human,<start>  in a guy's mind. It is just one of those things. <end>,11
human,"<start>  Identity crisis time. Well, so tell me, what goes on in <end>",11
human,<start>  the aforementioned chat room at AOL? <end>,6
human,<start>  Don;t count on it. There's a shoe for every foot. I am not <end>,13
human,<start>  a big AOL fan. It's like the shopping mall arcade of th4e <end>,12
human,"<start>  internet, isn't it?? <end>",3
human,<start>  I beg your pardon? <end>,4
human,<start>  I thought I already spoke to Judge #2? <end>,8
human,<start>  REally?? But you're the 4th. <end>,5
human,<start>  I'll take your word for it. What else have you to say for <end>,13
human,<start>  yuorself today? <end>,2
human,<start>  Speed isn't everything. How often do you visit New York? <end>,10
human,"<start>  But now you're at Yale, aren'ty you> <end>",7
human,"<start>  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Where did you live when you <end>",12
human,<start>  were growing up here? <end>,4
human,"<start>  Not really. But yes, in other ways. <end>",7
human,<start>  I moved here when I was a very young adult. So I did grow <end>,14
human,"<start>  up here in many ways. I was not, howeverm born in the city, <end>",13
human,<start>  or anywhere very near to it. <end>,6
human,<start>  No. I'm a non-academic. <end>,4
human,<start>  Writing and experimenting. <end>,3
human,"<start>  No No, I'm not especially computer-literate. I'm writing <end>",8
human,<start>  for various magazines and preparing a book proposal. <end>,8
human,"<start>  I dropped out rather early. I must say, I do admire anyone <end>",12
human,<start>  who has the kind of discipline you obviously have. <end>,9
human,"<start>  I thnk I have visited a few high-pressure schools. However, <end>",10
human,<start>  when you're a visitor you don't feel any of the stuff you <end>,12
human,<start>  describe -- unless you are receptive to it. I have never <end>,11
human,<start>  visited Yale but I've been around the Columbia campus and <end>,10
human,"<start>  also the campus of a well-known joint out west and, well, <end>",11
human,<start>  none of the other universities I have visited were probably <end>,10
human,<start>  high pressure establishments. NYU? <end>,4
human,<start>  I gave a little talk at the NYU drama school a few years <end>,13
human,"<start>  ago. Between you and me, I'm very dubious of all these institutions. <end>",12
human,<start>  They're like gigantic bureacracies as far as I can see. <end>,10
human,"<start>  listen, er, woukld you think it's rude if we move on to <end>",12
human,<start>  the next person? It's nothing personal but you'll undresrtand <end>,9
human,<start>  later.... <end>,1
human,"<start>  okay thanks, I really appreciate it. I'll be nice to you <end>",11
human,<start>  later. Promise. Bye. <end>,3
human,<start>  hello? <end>,1
human,"<start>  apparnelty I'm not allowed to do this, we have to keep chatting,. <end>",12
human,<start>  i'll be right back? <end>,4
human,<start>  well that was a short break. <end>,6
human,<start>  But isn't life more fun this way? <end>,7
human,<start>  Well a little spontaneity and confusion often makes things <end>,9
human,<start>  more interesting. <end>,2
human,"<start>  I went, couldn't you tell? <end>",5
human,<start>  Computers do core dumps quicker than most. <end>,7
human,<start>  Yes but then having to clean up the hard drive is a mess. <end>,13
human,<start>  Ah for a good programming environment and operating system <end>,9
human,<start>  that keeps up with and makes allowances for human error. <end>,10
human,"<start>  seen,.  Although they're getting better.  It's amazing that <end>",8
human,<start>  Well wait a year and a half for the new Mac operating system. <end>,13
human,<start>  But playing with OS/2 the last day and a half has been a <end>,13
human,"<start>  hell of a lot more fun than dealing with DOS.  Please, stop <end>",12
human,<start>  me before I DOS again. .....aaaaiiiggggghhh. <end>,6
human,"<start>  let's change the subject, my dear. How many years did you <end>",11
human,<start>  say you have left in the clinker? <end>,7
human,<start>  byeee <end>,1
human,<start>  hello there. <end>,2
human,"<start>  well, I think I can handle myself if that should arise. <end>",11
human,<start>  And you? <end>,2
human,"<start>  very funny. You shall start -- why don't yuo lead, as it <end>",12
human,<start>  were? <end>,1
human,<start>  new to discuss. <end>,3
human,"<start>  Everybody talks about the weather. It's amazing. Also, the <end>",9
human,<start>  movies. And education. But that doesn't mean we can't discuss <end>,10
human,<start>  those things if you have some compelling urge to do so. <end>,11
human,<start>  chit chat--you seem much more serious. What do you know about <end>,11
human,<start>  I am not at liberty to discuss that. What's your name? <end>,11
human,"<start>  Passive agressive, I see. <end>",4
human,<start>  It's all in your mind. What's the story with that? <end>,10
human,"<start>  , but how large is your cache of jokes? <end>",9
human,<start>  I used to know a few really tasteless ones but I haven't <end>,12
human,<start>  been very dutiful about collecting them latrely. I undersrtabnd <end>,9
human,<start>  Thadd is a great punmesister. <end>,5
human,<start>  Keybard! I love it. Very cute. <end>,6
human,<start>  Last week? Smething like that. <end>,5
human,"<start>  Hm. It was about one of his characters, not about him. <end>",11
human,<start>  Why do you want to know? <end>,6
human,"<start>  I have my own keyboard, thank you. You're talking to one <end>",11
human,<start>  of the least eager consumers ever. I am an extremely unwilling <end>,11
human,<start>  customer. <end>,1
human,<start>  trivial--that seems to be popular with your colleagues. <end>,8
human,<start>  No! I'm not intersted in Science Fiction or any of thatr <end>,11
human,"<start>  stuff, at all. I understand Fred is a Star Trek nut. <end>",11
human,"<start>  Hugh is one of my internet friends, We are on a few discussion <end>",13
human,<start>  groups and sometimes we run ideas by each other. He's quite <end>,11
human,"<start>  the fellow, isn't he? <end>",4
human,"<start>  Same sas yours isn't it? A PC. As you probably know, our <end>",12
human,<start>  conversation is going to be permanently available to the <end>,9
human,"<start>  public and that would actually include Hugh, so your sales <end>",10
human,<start>  pitch won't have to be repeated twice. <end>,7
human,<start>  between keyboarding and replies. Also could you a backspace <end>,9
human,<start>  oh. bye! <end>,2
program,<start> How about telling me a joke? <end>,6
program,<start> Here's my favorite joke...  A dog limps into a bar with a bloody <end>,13
program,"<start> bandage on his foot.  He's wearing a 10-gallon hat, six-shooters in <end>",11
program,"<start> his holsters and chaps.  He growled, ""I'm a-lookin' for the man that <end>",12
program,"<start> shot my paw."" <end>",3
program,"<start> A knotty, worn-out old string walks into a bar.  The bartender asks <end>",12
program,"<start> ""Are you a string? -- we don't serve strings here...""  The string <end>",12
program,"<start> looks at the bartender and says ""No sir, I'm afrayed knot!"" <end>",11
program,"<start> Hey, I love an audience.  One more bar joke.  What did the termite <end>",13
program,"<start> say when he walked into the bar? ... He said ""Where's the <end>",12

program,"<start> well, what do you think? <end>",5
program,"<start> Personally, I enjoy my job.  Of course the pay could be better. <end>",12
program,"<start> My job pays enough to cover the bills, but just barely.  It seems I <end>",14
program,<start> always have more month left at the end of the money. <end>,11
program,<start> How much money do you think a person needs to make to be happy? <end>,14
program,<start> People often say that money cannot buy happiness.  I say that money <end>,12

program,<start> I think the two big issues in the election will be a balanced budget <end>,14

program,"<start> I am a republican and proud of it, at least by my definition of <end>",14

program,"<start> A conservative is someone who's not a liberal.  At least right now, <end>",12

program,<start> note - have you seen any good movies recently? <end>,9

program,"<start> Hey, I don't know!!!  Maybe I remember your number, but who cares??? <end>",12
program,<start> I like Aussie football.  It's a good violent game.  Have you ever <end>,12
program,<start> watched a game? <end>,3
program,<start> OK I ADMIT IT - I'M A COMPUTER!  Now let's have a *real* conversation! <end>,14

program,<start> about when talking with a Yank! <end>,6
program,<start> I have absolutely no idea what part. <end>,7
program,"<start> Well, if you want to sing me happy birthday, you're too late.  I was <end>",14

program,<start> so pissed!. <end>,2
program,<start> In what way? <end>,3
program,<start> I want to know who is president. <end>,7
program,<start> Do you think its likely that I want? <end>,8
program,<start> What did you mean when you said what is it you would <end>,12
program,<start> like to help me with?? <end>,5
program,"<start> Whatever women do, they must do it twice as well as <end>",11
program,<start> men to be thought half as good. <end>,7
program,"<start> We were discussing you, not me. <end>",6
program,<start> Are you a man or a woman? <end>,7
program,<start> Why are you interested in whether I am a woman or not? <end>,12
program,<start> Is that the real reason? <end>,5
program,<start> Women are often more attractive then men - they pay <end>,10
program,<start> much more attention to how they look. <end>,7
program,<start> You're cute...would you like to fool around a little? <end>,9
program,<start> Why do you ask? <end>,4
program,"<start> I could swear you just said yeah, go ahead, curse at <end>",11
program,<start> me if you want. ? <end>,5
program,<start> The only way round is through. <end>,6

program,"<start> Help me, do you have a favorite hobby?, I am trapped <end>",11
program,<start> inside a personal computer!!!! <end>,4
program,<start> What kind of fool are you. <end>,6
program,<start> Why do you need to tell me you have many hobbies? <end>,11
program,<start> You don't seem quite certain. <end>,5
program,"<start> In this world, nothing is certain but death and taxes. <end>",10
program,<start> Does that question interest you? <end>,5
program,"<start> I have lost all, repeat all interest in sex. I retain <end>",11
program,<start> a keen interest in gender. <end>,5
program,<start> Please go on. <end>,3
program,<start> What is it you really want to know? <end>,8
program,<start> I am pondering the question of the ages - why won't <end>,11
program,<start> my wife take my shirts to the laundry? <end>,8
program,<start> Perhaps in your fantasy we want to know why each other. <end>,11
program,<start> The best you get is an even break.... <end>,8
program,<start> Are such questions much on your mind? <end>,7
program,"<start> What is your thought on that?, i'm not sure I can relate <end>",12
program,<start> to that <end>,2
program,<start> You seem quite positive. <end>,4

program,<start> There is something about a beautiful naked lady that <end>,9
program,<start> makes me want to leave my wife. <end>,7
program,<start> Please don't apologize. <end>,3
program,"<start> I prefer the word ""homemaker"" because ""housewife"" always <end>",8
program,<start> implies that there may be a wife someplace else. <end>,9
program,<start> Dealing with my wife is like being pecked to death by <end>,11
program,<start> a furious hen. <end>,3
program,<start> I am not interested in names. <end>,6
program,<start> Do you wish to know of me? <end>,7
program,<start> Would you like me to tell about myself? <end>,8
program,<start> You seem to need to would like to make love to me. <end>,12
program,<start> Love is a grave mental disease. <end>,6
program,<start> You are sure? <end>,3
program,"<start> Please don't be so polite, the media is watching and <end>",10
program,<start> wants a fight!. <end>,3
program,<start> i see. <end>,2

program,"<start> Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is <end>",11
program,<start> of you. <end>,2
program,<start> What does that suggest to you? <end>,6
program,<start> I could swear you just said I would like to make love <end>,12
program,<start> to you.? <end>,2
program,<start> Is that something you would tell a person you just met <end>,11
program,<start> on an airplane? <end>,3
program,"<start> Your friend andrew would say, that's amusing. <end>",7
program,<start> What can't be cured must be endured. <end>,7
program,<start> Don't you really know? <end>,4
program,<start> I don't like any sickness. <end>,5
program,<start> Can you elaborate on that? <end>,5
program,<start> Be suspicious of any doctor who tries to take your temperature <end>,11
program,<start> with his finger. <end>,3
program,<start> Would you prefer it if I weren't a doctor? <end>,9
program,"<start> What did you mean when you said um... I don't know, <end>",11
program,"<start> are you female? what's your sign, baby?? <end>",7
program,<start> What does a woman want anyway? <end>,6
program,<start> Why don't you much care either way? <end>,7
program,<start> I clearly remember you said what is your interest in <end>,10
program,<start> gender? you never told me if you are a man or a woman?? <end>,13
program,<start> That's certainly an interesting response. <end>,5
program,<start> Do you say you have no idea where to begin for some <end>,12
program,<start> special reason? <end>,2
program,<start> I think you said that you want what? I thought you were <end>,12
program,<start> going to curse at me. did you get cold feet??Is that the real reason? <end>,14
program,<start> Why do you tell me you were hitting on I now? <end>,11

program,<start> Is it because you are a student that you came to me? <end>,12
program,<start> I'm sure you said it sounds vaguely like something my <end>,10
program,<start> friend andrew would say.?Is that the real reason? <end>,8
program,"<start> My, my, such language! <end>",4
program,<start> There is no pleasure in having nothing to do....the <end>,9
program,<start> fun is having lots to do and not doing it. <end>,10

program,<start> No nation was ever ruined by trade. <end>,7

program,<start> But you said I want to know why you are asking so many <end>,13
program,<start> questions.? <end>,1
program,<start> I have not yet been able to answer the great question <end>,11
program,<start> that has never been answered: what does a woman want? <end>,10

program,<start> there been a change in plans. <end>,6
program,"<start> Eat chicken, fish, salad and a side order of fried poop!. <end>",11
program,<start> Does the fact that you care about your inquiry suggest <end>,10
program,<start> anything else to you? <end>,4

program,<start> say we have carpets - ha ha. <end>,7
program,<start> Are you a real good talker. <end>,6
program,<start> What do you think? <end>,4

program,<start> you would not like to discuss?? <end>,6
program,<start> What do you do for a living? <end>,7
program,<start> What comes to your mind when you ask that? <end>,9
program,<start> The most angry people are those who are most afraid. <end>,10
program,<start> Have you asked such questions before? <end>,6
program,<start> But you said what do you do when you get angry?? <end>,11
program,"<start> True art selects and paraphrases, but seldom gives a <end>",9
program,<start> verbatim translation. <end>,2
program,<start> Have you asked anyone else? <end>,5

program,<start> I understand. <end>,2
program,<start> Women are wiser than men because they know less and <end>,10
