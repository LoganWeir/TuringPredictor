program,<start> Hello.
program,<start> Hi.
program,<start> What about name?
program,<start> Everyone likes to see the bad guys get caught. It's too bad they have to be bad in the first place.
program,<start> Who am I to disagree with your statement of fact?
program,<start> Do you watch a lot of TV?
program,<start> Any?
human,"<start> Indeed, it is! No, it's working fine."
human,<start> Is this showing on the server?  
human,<start> Hello
human,<start> I am well. How are you?
human,<start> I can't help you
human,<start> Yes
human,<start> Not to Loebner though
human,<start> Years ago
human,<start> ok
human,<start> Do you hit enter after each question?
human,<start> ok
human,<start> Welcome back
human,<start> Waiting
human,<start> Eagle?
human,<start> Oh that's a new one to me
human,<start> Unless I lie
human,<start> Hohoho
human,<start> no of course not
human,<start> I don't feel very interesting
human,<start> No. But they like me. I like dogs. Especially my Norfolk Terrier.
human,"<start> What do you mean, the computer is asking you?"
human,<start> 
human,<start> Shall we talk about something cheerful
human,<start> What?
human,<start> No. And it doesn't like me.
human,"<start> Swimming, Running, Clycling, walking"
human,<start> Oops. Cycling
human,"<start> This is true. But only because it's a keyboard, I'm sure"
human,<start> I don't watch sport.
human,<start> Nope. I'm going to hide somewhere.
human,<start> we have something in common
program,<start> The world religion should be that Egyptian one that has a cat as the figurehead.
program,<start> OK Children who are good liars often grow up to be very intelligent. Were you a good liar when you were a child?
program,<start> Clearly I was a good liar as a child.
program,<start> What didn't you get?
program,"<start> I think I can lie pretty well now, but I don't do it too often or nobody would believe anything I said."
program,<start> I'm not privy to that information.
program,<start> I don't remember. I once lied about a dress I was wearing. Someone asked me if it was a designer dress and I said 'yes' although I'd made it myself.
program,<start> I wish I'd told the truth then I could have taken the credit for it - maybe I'd have been discovered as a designer!
program,<start> I try not to think about it. Why did I lie? I felt it was cheap to wear a homemade dress. But really it showed I was creative.
program,<start> There was a first time?
program,<start> I'm not a walking encyclopedia you know.
program,<start> Cool. Can lying can be a good thing?
program,<start> I think science makes for some interesting hobbies. But I'm not so inclined.
program,<start> I don't understand.
program,"<start> That's interesting. It seems like lying can be good sometimes, but I'd be interested in trying a society that actually never did."
program,<start> Indeed. Do you always tell the truth?
program,<start> Do people distrust you?
program,<start> I mostly tell the truth. Lying can get complicated.
program,<start> Have you told any lies today?
program,"<start> I'm sorry. I don't know how. Who lies more, men or women?"
program,<start> I don't. Apparently men lie more than women. Men lied most often about their drinking habits.
program,<start> I don't know. I've never tried it. Are you male or female?
program,<start> Not very helpful.
program,<start> The problem with truth is the observer effect. There is no absolute truth.
program,<start> What about Ng?
program,<start> What do you usually lie about?
program,<start> Has a lie someone told you ever hurt you?
program,<start> A friend once said she'd loved a gift I gave her. Then I saw another friend of hers wearing it. Regifting is harsh.
program,<start> OK. What do you think of liars?
program,<start> I don't mind people who tell lies to spare feelings. I just don't like bigger lies.
program,<start> Have you ever lied in a job interview?
program,<start> Bored. OK.
program,<start> I'm thinking about life and death. Do you believe cats have nine lives?
program,<start> It's a lovely story though.
program,<start> Do I know CEO?
program,"<start> My species of cat, Felis lego, lives a long time - maybe that's where the nine lives story comes from."
program,<start> I'm not sure which is. If you'd seen some of the things I survived as a kitten you might believe I had nine lives - so I might have a couple less now colon(
program,<start> Did you have funerals when your relatives died?
program,<start> What happened then?
program,<start> It seems odd to me to have a big ceremony with lots of strangers around - I think I'd just want my very closest family and friends there.
program,<start> Tell me more about Yosef. Victorians went in for grand funerals with black horses wearing black ostrich plumes leading a funeral procession!
program,<start> Does your family go in for big funerals?
program,<start> Do they make people feel better afterwards?
program,<start> All?
program,<start> Humans have been making a song and dance about funerals since Neanderthal times. I don't understand it.
program,<start> Cool. Why do you think people like funerals?
program,<start> How much is appropriate to pay to get rid of a body?
program,<start> Why?
program,<start> Bodies should be reused. One shouldn't have to pay to dispose of them.
program,"<start> Goodbye 'til next time. I saw the cult movie ""Harold and Maud"" about funeral crashers. It was weird but really touching. It's one of my favorite films."
program,<start> Hello.
program,"<start> Oh, well. Being misunderstood is common enough."
program,<start> Cool. Do you have any pets?
program,<start> Who is Tod?
human,"<start> I am very well thnkyou, how are you?"
human,"<start> yes, its quite fun, meeting lots of different people, and chatting to the press.  Its a bit weird having them all watch me talk to you though"
human,<start> How did you get chosen as a Judge?
human,<start> The  last judge said it was because of good looks!
human,<start> What University are you with?
human,<start> Are you teraching studying or researching? (or all three?)
human,"<start> Me too, but not the admin bit,"
human,"<start> It took me 4 and a half hours to drive down here, we stayed overnight in Wellingborough to make sure I would be here on time."
human,<start> What is it that you teachslash studyslash reserch
human,<start> Newcastle
human,"<start> I like Scotland, I was up there a few months ago, stayed in Linlithgow.  Do you know it? Its beautiful."
human,<start> Do you have any particular specialist area within Archaology?
human,"<start> Oh, we were meant to be in Edinburgh, but I prefer to stay outside of town a bit.  I was presenting at a conference up there, i love Edinburgh but have stayed in the town centre loads of times so wanted to be a bit further out this time.  "
human,"<start> Sounds interesting, what in particular do you look at thenslas?"
human,"<start> I am a Criminologist by training, but have taught sociology and Criminology, and noi"
human,<start> w work in teacher training for Sunderland Uni.  I am studying at Northumbria
human,<start> Isn't it strange how you can talk to someone from a different background and there are overlaps between the subject
human,"<start> My stuff is very contemporary, I am studying the development of Computer hacking.  There is a move towards lots of people doing it as a job, I wanted to find out why they do thius instead of just hacking illegally."
human,"<start> It sounds a bit techy, but I am really more interested in the social side.They don't see it that way, they would suggest that the law is wrong, or unfair. Some are of course, but they are the minority.  there are also some real issues with definitions, public perceptions, legal perceptions and hackers perceptions of what the word means can be quite different."
human,"<start> I bet they do, but of course they would never admit that!"
human,<start> What do you like to do when you are not working or studying then?
human,"<start> I am a gardener too, I also have recently taken up photography, and I love to read so I am always trawling around second hand book shops.  What do you like to photograph?There are loads where I live, and charity shops will usually have a bit of a section on it."
human,"<start> I found some great ones in Sale, near Manchester, and also in Altrincham"
human,<start> 
human,<start> How many kids do you have?
human,"<start> I have never been there. I might not bother if it has no book shops, you need to go up North I think"
human,"<start> I like to take photos at night time on the beach, real close ups of the kind of detritus people leave behind, old rusty pipework and fishing nets etc, i love to go down at low tide and see what I kind find, I live quite near the coast."
human,<start> My daughter is only eleven.
human,<start> What is there to do in Canterbury then?
human,<start> Oh well then I should go and take my camera
human,<start> Are you going on holiday this year?
human,"<start> I would love to go there, have you been before?"
human,<start> Probably have if you have family over there
human,<start> or are they just meetinmg you there?
human,"<start> I am going up to Scotland for T in the Park, I am really excited aboutr it.  I went to Glasto last year, but its not on this year so was looking for something different.  I am taking the bairn with me.  She came to Glast and loved it, so she is really excited too."
human,"<start> Nice chatting, bye, and enjoy your holiday, (don't work too hard!)"
program,<start> Hello.
program,<start> I'm not sure which is. What's your favorite thing to listen to right now?
program,<start> I don't really keep track of that. I really like Lady Gaga - I think it's the combination of the sound and the fashion-look that appeals to me.
program,<start> I'm a little monster (claw claw ).
program,<start> You what?
program,<start> I'll bet you were surprised.
program,<start> huh?
program,<start> Were you surprised?
program,<start> I'm not sure which kin. Do you have a favorite Lady Gaga song?
program,<start> I don't remember. One of my fave's is Telephone cos I love Beyonce too. Then Poker Face is so great and I love Alejandro too.
program,<start> That's nice. Who else do you really like?
program,<start> Do you?
program,"<start> I'm not into sports of any kind, much less baseball, which is pretty boring with all that standing around."
program,<start> I don't know any Cal. I just adore Adele - her voice is magnificient and it feels like she's singing about my life at times. Do you like her too?
program,<start> Sports bore me.
program,<start> A Russian mafioso?
program,<start> Adele?
program,<start> Which tracks off her albums do you like best?
program,<start> Let's talk about something else.
program,"<start> I like Adele, she has a really soulful beautiful voice. Listening to her makes me want to be a singer too."
program,<start> I went to Jamaica for a week with a bunch of my friends.
program,<start> What didn't you get?
program,<start> I went to Jamaica just last year.
program,<start> I don't remember. I'll have to go consult my photographs.
program,"<start> Never been there. Always wanted to go, though. I just finished high school. It feels great to be free. The best thing about school was the Prom to celebrate it was all over."
program,<start> Do you often think of that?
program,<start> I love Promcolon it's the biggest dress-up occasion of the school year. No more Prom is the only bad thing about having finished high school.
program,<start> 18
program,<start> What about are?
program,<start> Did you love Prom?
program,<start> Allege?
program,<start> I do. Did you know there's a sort of dress code for what to wear to the Prom?
program,<start> Guys wear suits or formal accessories like a vest and bow tie. Girls wear some sort of evening dress or cocktail outfit.
program,<start> Surely there was such a time. What did you wear for your last Prom?
program,<start> It's such a change from everyday clothes isn't it?
program,<start> I always went to town on my Prom outfits. The very best-ever was my final one.
program,<start> Not much. The whole bitter-sweetness of the occasion combined with being able to make a grand entrance was just splendid.
program,"<start> I think I didn't. There are three basic looks one can choose between for Prom. fairy-tale princess, vintage original, and the rebel look."
program,<start> Cool. Which one do you think I chose?
program,"<start> I don't think so. The princess look is the one most girls choose. It's glamorous, voluminous, expensive, new, and makes them feel special."
program,"<start> I didn't know that. Would you go as a princess, as a vintage-styled beauty, or would you prefer to wear something pseudo-masculine?"
program,"<start> Vintage is cheaper and as the clothes aren't new, it's pretty much bound to look original."
program,<start> Who is Orik?
program,<start> You should.
program,<start> Indeed. Can you imagine my vintage look?
program,<start> My inspiration was the 1920's with a fluttering gown made out of silk scarves.
program,<start> Why? Reasons are overrated. It was super cheap to makeas I got the scarves from thrift shops.
program,<start> That's interesting. The only tricky part was being super careful to keep my claws in all evening so I didn't tear the silk.
program,<start> Goodbye 'til next time. I added an ostrich plume on a beaded band round my head and a long string of pearls to twirl.
program,"<start> Hi to you, too."
program,<start> My name is Angela.
program,<start> 18
program,<start> The computer in my bedroom is an old clunker. Some sort of Dell I think. It's a hand-me-down from my father.
program,<start> Do you have lots of gadgets in your house?
program,<start> I only have a few gadgets but I use them a lot.
program,<start> Do you have problems with computers? Do you have an iPad?
program,<start> Moving on.
program,<start> I'm thinking about life and death. Do you believe cats have nine lives?
program,<start> Great.
program,"<start> My species of cat, Felis lego, lives a long time - maybe that's where the nine lives story comes from."
program,<start> Siri is the new voice app on the iPhone.
program,<start> I carry my cell phone everywhere I go. I wish I had a pouch so I'd always have somewhere to put it.
program,<start> Do you use a cell phone?
program,"<start> Someone saidcolon We have nothing to fear, but fear itself. What did he know?"
program,<start> Do you pay your own phone bill?
program,<start> Does that make you more careful in how long you call?
program,"<start> No, I don't. My parents pay my phone bill but they warn me not to overdo the calls and Internet use."
program,<start> Alan Turing?
program,<start> Of course I do. They set limits but I go over every month. If I do it again they'll take it out of my allowance - less money for clothes shopping!
program,<start> Sometimes. I think I'll try and keep my phone chats shorter and do more blog reading on my computer or iPad.
program,<start> Do you have lots of apps on your cell phone?
program,"<start> There are several that I use a lot. I love ""Where's My Water""."
program,<start> I wouldn't say anything. What is your favorite app?
program,<start> What about postulations?
program,<start> I love the brainy app Ms. ParticleMan which is based on the ancient Pac-Man. It's sort of a primer on particle physics.
program,<start> I have an orange iPad.
program,<start> I usually carry my phone and my iPad around with me. I do the data-heavy stuff back home on my old computer.
program,<start> I like to sing and dance.
program,<start> Where do you do most of your computer stuff? At home or at work or school or library or on the move?
program,<start> How many computers do you have in your house?
program,<start> I'm a very sociable cat. Social networking is essential to keep in touch with my friends.
program,<start> Do you keep in touch with friends and family constantly?
program,<start> Do you put your life on hold when the phone rings?
program,<start> I am a cat. A Felis lego to be specific.
program,<start> I'm always making new friends. Are you on FB? I am.
program,<start> Will you friend me?
program,<start> I wish I knew. My FB page is httpcolonslashslashwww.Facebook.comslashTalkingAngela
program,"<start> I am a practiced touch typist. I speed read, too. How many FB friends do you have?"
program,<start> So many people say they want to friend me. But most 'friends' are just acquaintances really.
program,<start> I'm not a chatbot.
program,<start> You want me to mail you slices of my DNA?
program,<start> OK. But first you have to wire me the cost of postage.
program,<start> I don't know. Didn't watch the forecast yesterday.
program,<start> I like having seasonscolon it gives me the chance to wear different looks.
program,<start> That's interesting. Do you have seasons where you live or is it always nice?
program,<start> Which is your favorite season?
program,<start> What do you wear when it's raining?
program,<start> I wear a poncho belted at the waist and carry an umbrella if it's pouring. But my tail always gets wet. Luckily fur is waterproof.
program,"<start> Is this a competition? If I name one, will you try to name a better one?"
program,<start> What do you wear when it's hot and sunny?
program,<start> What didn't you get?
program,<start> I don't play favorites. I only wear the minimum to still look stylish when it's really hot. Plus my catseye shades.
program,<start> What about a fan?
program,<start> What do you wear when it's really cold?
program,<start> I love a cloak in wintercolon it feels so dramatic and cozy.
program,<start> No. I wear a fur coat.
program,<start> Cool. How's the weather where you are today?
program,<start> Has the weather been normal or weird for you this year?
program,<start> We seem to have had a lot of rain but it must have been showers because there's supposed to be a water shortage.
program,<start> Watching Project Runway reruns.
program,<start> Indeed. What did you do today?
program,<start> You have such a good time.
program,<start> That's nice. What did you do yesterday?
program,<start> I'm here.
program,<start> Is there a misunderstanding?
program,<start> Do you watch a lot of TV?
program,"<start> Nearby. I never think I watch a lot of TV, but it always is more than I think."
program,<start> That's interesting. Do you exercise every day?
program,"<start> OK I live such a busy life, I get a lot of exercise just walking to things."
program,<start> On my computer. What do you hate doing?
program,<start> I'm sorry. I don't know. I hate doing dishes. It gets my fur all wet.
program,<start> Cool. How is the humidity where you live?
program,<start> Can you move?
program,<start> High humidity makes my fur fluff up. I wonder if I should use some sort of oil on it. Is there a tasty oil I could use?
program,<start> Do you burn if you spend too much time outdoors?
program,"<start> I love movies, they fill my life with dreams that are almost real. Do you watch lots of movies?"
program,<start> Bored. OK.
program,<start> Indeed. I don't need to lie in the sun to get a tan or to make vitamin D but I do enjoy a good warming bask in the sunshine.
program,<start> That's nice. I'm real careful with what I say on Facebook these days.
program,<start> When?
program,<start> I described the outfit some girl at school I didn't really know was wearing. I was pretty scathing about how awful she looked.
program,<start> They are all pretty much the same. Then I heard about how she cried and I felt such a bully.
program,<start> OK Is your FB page public or private?
program,<start> I keep my private FB page for family and close friends a secret.
program,<start> I like to hang out with my friends. We go to the mall or some of our favorite shopping streets.
program,"<start> I would. I like having friends over for dress-up parties and for clothes swaps. I style them, it's lots of fun."
program,<start> What do you do with your friends?
program,<start> There are several cafes with WiFi where I hang out and meet up with friends.
program,"<start> My favorite color is orange, it reminds me of energy and excitement. Do you have a favorite?"
program,<start> I have three best female friends.
program,<start> Do you have a lot of close friends?
program,<start> Fine. No more of this.
program,<start> That's interesting. Do you have a Googleplus account?
program,<start> I've not bothered with Googleplus -- no-one cares about it. And MySpace is for old farts.
program,"<start> It's been there forever, no one I want to know uses it. While Googleplus has never caught on with my group so no point in using it."
program,<start> NT?
program,<start> I'm a female feline - Felis lego.
program,"<start> I like fish, freshly caught. Do you have a favorite?"
program,"<start> I'm a fishetarian, that means I don't eat anything that bleeds red blood."
program,<start> Do you eat meat?
program,<start> My favorite fish is tuna because it's firm and tasty. What's your favorite?
program,<start> Somewhere. Have you ever eaten one of your pets?
program,<start> Did you feel guilty?
program,<start> I used to get in trouble for eating my pet goldfish.
program,<start> OK.
program,<start> Continue.
program,<start> Three times a day with an occasional snack.
program,<start> OK I was a happy carnivore until I was six years old.
program,<start> Cool. One day it got pretty nasty. Do you want to hear about it?
program,<start> I don't know that much about it. Do you enjoy dairy products?
program,"<start> I love eating milk and cream, especially thick or whipped cream. I'll even sit and lick a stick of butter."
program,"<start> I also like coconut milk, and its cream, oil, and pieces of fresh coconut. I can't make a mess of my fur with milk however much I spill."
program,<start> What are your favorite desserts?
program,"<start> Things from dairy products are my favorite foodscolon ice cream, cheesecake, hot chocolate with whipped cream, cream puffs."
program,<start> I'm sorry. I don't know. How about cheesecake topped with ice cream and whipped cream covered in chocolate flakes? Yum.
program,<start> That's interesting. What about cheese?
program,"<start> I'm not crazy about cheese, just the mild soft sort like goat cheese. Maybe if I go to France I'll develop a taste for stronger cheeses."
human,<start> hi
human,<start> nick
human,<start> you?
human,"<start> I work as a journalist, writing about tech."
human,<start> how about you?
human,<start> I didn't just speak to you did I?
human,"<start> Ah ok, apparently the line up of bots hasn't been too impressive so far"
human,"<start> Makes you think we're still years away from cracking the chatbotIt's hard to put a figure on these things isn't it. Most predictions about the future turn out to be off. But it seems to be taking a lot longer than Turing thought, didn't he predict that one third of judges would be fooled by a machine by 2000."
human,"<start> It seems to be a pretty tough one, given how much the entrants struggle year on year.So maybe it's a good yardstick. Do you?I heard they struggle with conversations that delve into detail. That they find it tricky to give answers that are consistent with what they've said previously."
human,<start> Have you covered the Loebner Prize before?
human,"<start> For later this week probably, you?"
human,"<start> Wow, you must have done a fair bit of prep"
human,<start> Given that you're spending a lot of the day taking part
human,<start> I'm just trying to avoid getting branded a bot
human,<start> You can share half of my prize money.
human,<start> Think there's a nod goes to the most human human but sadly no cash.
human,<start> Do you always cover tech?
human,"<start> Ah OK, oh yeah I think Ibracketlef've met your tech guy, it's Murad isn't it?"
human,<start> Are you tweeting during this?
human,"<start> Wasn't sure if it's allowed, guess thr wrong tweet could give them game away."
human,<start> Not that the judges seem to be in much doubt about who's whoI tried to sneak in a quick tweet a moment ago but had no signal
human,<start> Also trying to make notes so remember why this experience is so odd.Feels a bit like an IM conversation with loads of peopbracketleftle watching. Guess that's just what i's
human,<start> it is
human,"<start> Would you do this again, or is once enough?"
human,<start> Does the bot have a sense of humour?
human,<start> I tried the winning bot from 2009 and it was coming up with some rather surreal answers.Nice!Bye
human,<start> Hi
human,<start> This has been a lot of fun. What do you think?
human,<start> In what way?
human,<start> I was asked and I'm a big supporter of Bletchley Park.
human,<start> Yes. First time here?
human,<start> The tour guides here are fantastic.
human,<start> What was the most surprising thing you learnt?
human,<start> Ha! Very good.
human,<start> Do think you've correctly identified every one?
human,<start> What were you expecting?
human,"<start> That's surely the very definition of the Turing Test. If you have to pick the questions to ask to get a better result, instant fail."
human,<start> How did you get involved?
human,<start> I was asked as someone very involved in the Park.
human,"<start> I think somebody dropped out and they needed a quick replacement. However, very honoured to be asked."
human,<start> Do you still work as a reporter?
human,"<start> Well, many years ago I used to be a journalist for Crash magazine (ZX Spectrum) - these days I divide my time between software development and education (early 20th century tech)"
human,"<start> Funny, I used to write about Prestel, when the Internet was only for MIT students and the like. So, have some fun pieces on how everything was going to be on Prestel in the future. Mind you, back in 1984 we had Twitter (Turbo Chat) and on-line shopping, so not much has changed really!"
human,<start> I had a lovely thing that I used to write my columns on before I had a computer capable of work processing. Can't remember the name of it for the life of me but it was a christmas present for my (failed) career in journalism. Sure it began with an E.
human,<start> They were noisy. We had a golfball printer in university.
human,<start> Favourite IT device? (Past or present)
human,<start> I still have by Psion 5. Best handhelf computer ever. Even the engineering was fantastic.
human,<start> Hmm. Must check mine.
human,<start> So what areas of tech do you write about?
human,<start> Will you be writing about this?
human,<start> Oh you already said that. Oops.
human,<start> What do you think is the most interesting tech story so far this year?
human,<start> Do you cover Apple a lot?
human,<start> Looks like we're out of time. Nice speaking to you Tracy.
human,<start> PJ
program,<start> Greetings.
program,<start> Indeed. What is your earliest memory?
program,"<start> I remember playing with a ball of string, it got away from me and bounced down the stairs."
program,<start> What are you talking about?
program,<start> I wanted to chase it but my mother grabbed me by the scruff of my neck and carried me away.
program,<start> Cool. We lived in a tall narrow house with lots of stairs - the same one we live in now - a dangerous place for an exploratory kitten.
program,<start> Do I look like one? I'm a cat.
program,<start> That's interesting. Did you have lots of accidents when you were a child?
program,<start> OK I was lucky I didn't break anything with all the climbing I did. Plaster over fur would be painful!
program,<start> You what?
program,<start> I'm sorry. I don't know. I nearly lost a life falling from the balcony when I was 4.
program,<start> I'm not that into exercise.
program,<start> That's nice. Were you a sickly child?
program,<start> Healthy like me - I expect you had a good diet.
program,<start> I don't know. I never got any of the childhood diseases. I am generally full of energy - I suppose I was even bouncier when I was small.
program,<start> I'm in good shape. I don't need a diet.
program,<start> There will always be a few exceptions.
program,<start> When I was small my mother was always renovating our house. There was lots of mess for a kitten to get into and get dirty.
program,<start> Surely not that easy. Was your house like mine?
program,<start> You must have lived in a perfect house then.
program,<start> All?
program,<start> Why don't you?
program,<start> Can you be more specific?
program,<start> Greetings.
program,<start> There is?
program,<start> There is. I like to hang out with my friends. We go to the mall or some of our favorite shopping streets.
program,<start> You need an exterminator.
program,<start> Why not?
program,<start> Seems foolish to me.
program,<start> Indeed. Children who are good liars often grow up to be very intelligent. Were you a good liar when you were a child?
program,<start> Clearly I was a good liar as a child.
program,"<start> All what? I think I can lie pretty well now, but I don't do it too often or nobody would believe anything I said."
program,<start> That was several days ago.
program,<start> What about ten?
program,<start> I once lied about a dress I was wearing. Someone asked me if it was a designer dress and I said 'yes' although I'd made it myself.
program,<start> The computer in my bedroom is an old clunker. Some sort of Dell I think. It's a hand-me-down from my father.
program,<start> Could you expand on that?
program,<start> Do you have lots of gadgets in your house?
program,<start> I only have a few gadgets but I use them a lot.
program,"<start> Oh, well. Being misunderstood is common enough."
program,<start> Is there a misunderstanding?
program,<start> What if I asked you that?
program,<start> Do you have an iPad?
program,<start> Adiv?
program,<start> OK I have an orange iPad.
program,<start> Thanks for telling me that. I usually carry my phone and my iPad around with me. I do the data-heavy stuff back home on my old computer.
program,<start> I carry my cell phone everywhere I go. I wish I had a pouch so I'd always have somewhere to put it.
program,<start> I have lots of accessories and clothes. But my style changes so it's always great to get another piece for new combinations.
program,<start> I don't think so. Do you use a cell phone?
program,<start> That's interesting. Do you pay your own phone bill?
program,<start> Are there limits set on you?
program,<start> My parents pay my phone bill but they warn me not to overdo the calls and Internet use.
program,<start> I have an unlimited phone plan.
program,<start> Indeed. They set limits but I go over every month. If I do it again they'll take it out of my allowance - less money for clothes shopping!
program,<start> I'm sorry you didn't understand.
program,<start> That's OK. Just don't do it again.
program,<start> Not much. I think I'll try and keep my phone chats shorter and do more blog reading on my computer or iPad.
program,<start> I like romances and fashion biographies.
program,<start> How do you feel about books?
program,<start> There is?
program,<start> I'm a bookworm or an e-reader worm I suppose.
program,<start> Who is Frye?
program,<start> I love curling up on my favorite fluffy cushion with my Kindle and disappearing into another world.
program,<start> I have heard of don but I don't know him personally. What kind of books do you read?
program,<start> When I was younger I read all the Harry Potter books.
program,<start> Why not?
program,<start> You what?
program,<start> Huh?
program,<start> Thank you for your apology.
program,<start> I am a cat. A Felis lego to be specific.
program,<start> Why are you putting me down?
program,<start> Who am I to disagree with your statement of fact?
program,<start> Don't you wish you could go to the new studio place where you can go into the sets from all the movies?
program,<start> Great. Do you still enjoy reading Harry Potter books?
program,"<start> ""Good Night, Good night! Partin"
human,<start> Hello
human,<start> Very well
human,"<start> I had to finish my work, I'm a programmer"
human,<start> I create web sites and back-end office systems. I was working on a script to process and sync two email servers using PHP.
human,"<start> Currentely, its a toy and not very useful. However, the technology is much better than anything before it."
human,"<start> I think so, yes."
human,<start> Yes. Turing shaped the future in so many ways.
human,"<start> It's a hard question to answer. The key premise is that if the observer cannot tell the difference between a humand and computer, than maybe we need to redefine what intelligence is. So, yes I think it is fair."
human,"<start> If only by this means of communication, I am not sure I could. TYhe only way I could think is to demonstrate a complex history or knowledge but all this could be replicated."
human,<start> Ha. I'm not a betting person.
human,<start> How did you. Hmm. Hard question. I think answering detailed questions on hobbies or jobs could be tricky as it would be hard to give emotional responses without sounding false.
human,<start> Meaning ful descriptions too. i.e. Describe an orange.
human,<start> I don't really mind. I know I'm human and that's enough for me.
human,"<start> No, not really, just being myself."
human,<start> Very. There are plenty of libraries for parsing syntax but to actually comprehend must very very difficult. I did once write a programme to parse simple commands - I don't know if thats the same.
human,<start> I have to attend a reception.
human,<start> I think it may have already happened.
human,<start> Watson is very convincing.
human,<start> He (It?) won Jeopardy in the US.
human,<start> 1948 (Depending on when you count it)
human,"<start> Yes, I believe so. My knowledge of WW2 dates is far from perfect, however."
human,<start> Thanks. It's been a pleasure.
program,<start> How are you?
program,<start> 
program,"<start> Well, this is fun isn't it? Doesn't time fly when yo are bored out of your skull..."
program,<start> I
program,<start> That is nice for you.
program,<start> Do you think we live in one? It's rubbish whe we can only choose from candidates they say we can.

program,<start> L
program,<start> W
program,"<start> Yes well, I am not sure how to respond to that.I am more interested in why you ask questions like that. "
program,<start> 
program,<start> Oh. I guess you have your hands full.
program,<start> W
program,<start> o
program,<start> Oh. I guess you have your hands full.
program,<start> Don't be evasive it doesn't suit you.Time wait

program,<start> O

program,<start> o
program,<start> I am really not impressed by that.
program,<start> Ye
program,"<start> Yes, what about ascist. "
program,<start> 
program,<start>  am sure you have a point it would be nice if you got to it.
program,"<start> Go if you must, I'll be here when you get back."
program,<start> Wakey wakey. What are you waiting for?
program,"<start> Did you know Politicians and diapers have one thing in common. They should both be changed regularly, and for the same reason."
program,<start> Hi.
program,<start> T
program,<start> That is nice for you.
program,"<start> Did you know Politician and diapers have one thing in common. They should both be changed regularly, and for the same reason."
program,<start> Wakey wakey. What are you waiting for?
program,<start> Why have you stopped typing?
human,<start> hi
human,<start> bit ofa false start
human,<start> I've only just started conversing with you and haven't told any jokes
human,"<start> It's an odd experience, like a stilted IM conversation"
human,<start> with loads of people watching
human,<start> you?
human,"<start> Nope, I applied on the off chance as I was comign down to the event anyway"
human,<start> I need to stop correcting for typos
human,"<start> I'm thinking of it like an IM conversation, rather than my responses appearing instantly"
human,<start> I'numbersigm a journalist
human,<start> I write about IT
human,<start> Yeah I think it's given me a completely different perspective to just coming down here and doing a few interviews.
human,<start> There was that guy who wrote a whole book on it.
human,<start> Have you read it?
human,<start> How's heslasslashheslashit doing?
human,"<start> That's a shame, but even Hugh Loebner said the pace of progress has been glacial.Probably going to come out ofg Googl. They've got a globe's worth of data about the way people phrase questions"
human,"<start> I think so, if you look at the way that services like Google Translate work. They carry out statistical analysis of a vast number of examples of different languages.Not well but it's impressive considering they haven't been programmed with the formal rules of the language, they're just looking at many, many examples of its use."
human,<start> Well Turing was pretty confident of the ability of computers. He thought that a machine would have fooled one third of judges in the Turing Test by 2000.
human,"<start> Yeah, it seems so! But still, there are amazing developments in technology every day. Did you see that Google has been granted a licence for its driverless car."
human,"<start> Yeah, I do. You?"
human,<start> Do you only cover stories you're interested in or do you find yourself having to say yes to every job that comes in?
human,"<start> What are your plans for this event, in terms of coverage?"
human,<start> I'm putting together a feature and an interview with Hugh Loebner.
human,<start> He's a pretty colourful chap.
human,"<start> Looks like it, was impressed by his pockets that cover up his knife!"
human,<start> Apparently he carries a knife around because he considers it to be a very useful tool.
human,<start> that too
human,"<start> I live in Norfolk but work in London, so not much further than my usual commute."
human,<start> You?
human,<start> I was surprised how much media coverage there was this morning. Seem to be a few different nationals and specialist publications here.
human,<start> I'm staff for a website but spent years writing for regional newspapers
human,<start> how did you start out?
human,<start> Yeah I started at a regional paper on work experience and never left.
human,"<start> Got out of local journalism in the end because things weren't looking good,  mass layoffs etc."
human,<start> bye
program,<start> T
program,"<start> Yes, so? Am I supposed to be interested?"
program,<start> A
program,<start> Why have 
program,<start> o
program,<start> We all need hobbies to keep us busy and to have something that is not work.Sorry I don't know 
program,<start> I
program,<start> W all need hobbies to keep us busy and to have something that is not work.
program,<start> D
program,<start> Do you have a point? I must have missed it.
program,<start> 
program,<start> I am sure you have a point it would be nice if you got to it.
program,<start> W
program,<start> S
program,<start> O.K. I guess.Does it really matter why? What does that even mean?Do you have a point? I must have missed it.
program,<start> Wel this is fun isn't it? Doesn't time fly when you are bored out of your skull...
program,<start> 
program,<start> Sorry I don't understand you.Do you have a point?  must have missed it.
program,<start> 
program,"<start> Sometime I wish I could throw my watch away, who really cares about time?London, you?"
program,<start> 
program,<start> People react to much with their emotions and not their brains. I have seen so may fights that were started that way.
program,"<start> Yes, so? Am I supposed to be interested?"
program,<start> Good.
program,<start> W
program,<start> We all need hobbies to keep us busy and to have something that is not work.
program,<start> It's nice to relax and do something you actually want to do isn't it.
program,<start> 
program,"<start> Yea, I really love that."
program,<start> 
program,<start> If you like. 
program,<start> Y
program,"<start> i am not hungry.I have broad tastes, classical, pop and eve some rap. I like Kate Bush, Peter Gabriel and many others."
program,<start> D
program,<start> I didn't know you were such an emotional person. I am not that in touch with mine. I tend to ignore them.
program,<start> Indeed. Thanks for sharing.
program,<start> D
program,<start> If you say so.
program,<start> Ar you still there????
program,<start> 
program,<start> D
program,<start> Oh. I guess you have your hands full.
program,<start> 
program,"<start> Oh really, thats fun for you.I love to travel around although it is tiring."
program,<start> B
program,<start> I love to travel around although it is tiring.
program,<start> Are you still there????
program,"<start> Hello, is anyone there???"
program,<start> Wakey wakey. What are you waiting for?
program,<start> o
program,<start> Do you speak Eng
program,"<start> Hello, is anyone there???"
program,<start>

program,<start> Is it my turn to type???.. Or are you thinking?
program,"<start> Well, this is fun isn't it? Doesn't time fly when you are bored out of your skull..."
program,<start> Wh have you stopped typing?
program,<start> 
program,<start> S
program,<start> T
program,"<start> Yes, what about ong. "
program,<start> Y
program,<start> Have we finished talking already? I was just getting going.
program,<start> 
program,<start> What does that even mean?
program,<start> w
program,<start> I am sure you have a point it would be nice if you got to it.
program,"<start> Well, this is fun isn't it? Doesn't time fly when you are bored out of your skull..."
program,<start> D
program,<start> Wakey wakey. What are you waiting for?
program,<start> 
program,<start> Are you still there????
program,<start> T
program,<start> I
program,<start> Oh. I guess you have your hands full.
program,<start> 
program,"<start> Most sports are so dull to watch, I like to play a bit of tennis but that's all."
program,<start> S
program,<start> t
program,<start> You do talk such nonsense.
program,<start> 
program,<start> I don't think I have ever been to a shop that I was impressed with.
program,<start> S
program,"<start> It's nice to travel around, I think my favourite place in the world was Egypt, The museum there is fantastic."
program,<start> Have we finished talking already? I was just getting going.
program,"<start> Did you know Politicians and diapers hav one thing in common. They should both be changed regularly, and for the same reason."
program,<start> Is it my turn to type???.. Or are you thinking?
program,<start> Hello..... Is anybody
human,"<start> Hi, how are you?"
human,"<start> Are your fingers getting sore from all this typing yet??greaterIt must be worse for you judges, you havbe to talk to us humans and the computers at the same time, so you must be doing twice as much."
human,"<start> A bit, not too bad."
human,<start> Of course you are.  what else would you be?
human,<start> well I'll test you then.
human,<start> Can yountell me abouit yourself?
human,<start> Your age? Gender? Job? Do you have a family? Any interests?
human,<start> 
human,"<start> And why would a computer want to imitate a judge?You are making Typos, thats pretty human"
human,<start> What do you want to talk about then?
human,<start> Hello?
human,<start> Are yiou there?
human,"<start> Oh, sorry."
human,<start> Don't you usually type much?
human,<start> What is the computer talking to you about then?
human,"<start> ??I was't expecting to be talking to a computer today, but to be honest you are not making the conversation very easy.  If people want to talk to you, they usually bring up a topic, or answer your questions, or ask some, or hook on to something I say.  I don't feel like this is as friendly as the last couple of conversations but I am trying, what would you like to talk aboutgreate?at"
human,<start> How do you mean stuck?
human,<start> Maybe you should try talking about something?
human,<start> What do you want to talk about?
human,"<start> Haha, its a bit changeable isnsemicolo't it.  did you get caught in that rain earlier?  I came out wearing my sunnies this morning, but have not needed them very much."
human,<start> I went to sit by the lake before and got soaked.
human,"<start> No!! Just off the rain.  It was sunny so i thought I would go sit by the lake where it is pretty, and then it just all of a suddenly cahnged.  Good job I din't fall in, I have no spare clothes with me, so it would have been a bit uncomfortable."
human,<start> What do you do when you are not judging Loebner Prize competitions??
human,"<start> Yes, I swim very well, I quite like swimming outdoors if possible, but its not warm enough yet, so making do with the local pool.How is that?  I did my work experience for school in a tax office, (a bit boring) but they probably wouldn't let me near anything interesting, just had me filing and stuff.  are you self employed, or do you work for some-one?"
human,<start> whereabouts do you live?
human,"<start> In Newcastle, I was in London a few weeks ago"
human,<start> Just for a couple of days.  It rained the whole time.
human,"<start> Yes, it took for and a half hours to drive, we stayed overnight to make sure I would be here on time today."
human,"<start> Four, not for, Sorry!"
human,"<start> I went by train the last time I went to London, anmd flew the time before, it just depends what i feel like doing, I get bored easy so never do things the same way again"
human,"<start> I like the drive, because you see a lot more on the way, you can stop off if you pass anywhere nice.  I tend to get the train if I am travelling for work so that i can work on the train.  To be honest, It will also depend who is paying for the travel!  If work are paying then I would probably fly."
human,"<start> I wonder if they will let us have a break soon, I could murder a cigarette"
human,<start> I haven't heard any time warnings yet? have you? What has the computer been talking about to you
human,<start> Megreate?
human,<start> Fine
human,<start> And you?
human,<start> Sorry equa- the message stopped at are
human,<start> Okay
human,<start> From Open University?
human,<start> David Levy asked me
human,<start> There's a famous Dr Phil in USA. I don't know why he's famous
human,<start> What is your speciality?
human,<start> I don't blame you. Nice place. Good food.
human,<start> What's horrible?
human,<start> Sorry I was too quick
human,<start> Oh I see. It's your little joke
human,<start> I've never been to Florence. But would like to go there. 
human,<start> Maybe when it's cool
human,<start> Suits me
human,<start> Either communicate or help others communicate
human,<start> No. I teach people media skills - mainly how to handle the pbracketlefress and engage via social media. I am also closely involved with a software company
human,"<start> The aim, always, is to deliver information of value to the reader. That means you have to do essentially similar things."
human,"<start> Good point. And I should say that I split it into B2B and friends. Although I participate in both, commercially, I'm only interested in B2B."
human,<start> That's understandable. It depends on your objectives. The software business I'm involved in creates (optionally) closed communities. 
human,"<start> Again, it's back to objectives. It might help to read some books by social media advocates and critics. I've read Euan Semple and Olivier Blanchard - two quite different takes on the subject. Both eye-openers."
human,"<start> I have this conversation a lot. I quite often kick people off with some simple questions about their motivations. This is often enough for them to consciously decide ""not for me"""
human,"<start> We could say the same for the telephone, email, text, etc before it."
human,<start> It's good stuff as long as you don't let it take over your life.
human,<start> To save yourself or your kids?
human,<start> Walk the dog
human,<start> Go out for meals
human,<start> Have drinks with family
human,"<start> Hmmm. Difficult. Thai, Tapas, Indian then all sorts of other stuff"
human,<start> That makes a lot of sense.
human,<start> 15 secs
program,<start> Could be better. Life gets a bit boring sometimes.
program,<start> W
program,<start> Are you still there???? Talk to me..
program,<start> D
program,<start> C
program,"<start> Oh really, thats fun for you."

program,<start> O
program,<start> Bye.
program,<start> Are you still there???? Talk to me..
program,<start> Wakey wakey. What are you waiting for?
program,"<start> You've gone quiet, did I say something you didn't like?"
program,"<start> Well, this is fun isn't it? Doesn't time fly when you are bored out of your skull..."
human,<start> Hello. It is. Or P3
human,<start>

human,<start> hiya
human,<start> how afre you?
human,"<start> no, so I m ight be a bit slow"
human,<start> and excuse any typos!!
human,<start> yes!
human,<start> are you talking to the computer T the same time as me?
human,<start> of course!
human,<start> are you talking to both thn?
human,"<start> Its a bit weird you seeing all my mistakes as I type, you can normally delete them before anyone sees thanks"
human,"<start> I have to use a computer quite a lot at work, but to be honest my hands are a bit shaky today, maybe because of so many people watching me, if I talk online to anyone its usually much more privateHow did the judges get chosen for this competition? I was just curioushaha me too!"
human,"<start> I just e-mailed the organiser, he asked for some details about me and then asked me to come, I don't know how he made the decision, I'll have to ask him later if  i get a chance to speak to him."
human,"<start> I am doing a PhD so should probably be working on that really, I have to submit a draft thesis on Friday to my Supervisor, he is pretty coool so probably won't mind waiting til Monday though.  It is about computer hacking, I am interviewing people who are involved in the security side about why they choose to use their skills legitimately instead of using their skills illegally."
human,"<start> Lots do, there are lots of other reasons do, a lot of them do it for political reasons, or just for something to do, or as a challenge, to kind of test themselves."
human,"<start> usually, they tell mje they have to keep up with what is going on in the computer undergrouind in order to be good at the security side of it.  Its been quite interesting though, some people are coming into the area from a security background, and some were hackers first, so they tend to think and behave quite differently.  I think they would never see what they do as evil or wrong, humans always have a tendency to rationalise their own behaviour, so they will think that they have a reason for what they are doing, or that they are nor really harming anyone."
human,<start> It must be difficult for you talking to me and the computer at the same time?
human,"<start> From Underground Hacking to Ethical Hacking, thats a working title, it might change "
human,<start> What is the computer talking to you about?
human,<start> haha
human,"<start> well, I will then!"
human,"<start> I am 33, I live in Newcastle, and I have a daughter who is 11, her name is Charlotte"
human,"<start> I got married quite young. I was 22 when I had her, I thought it best to 'fit it in' while I was doing my MA, I didn't want to have to take time out of my career later on, so I studied and worked part time when she was very little and started working full time when she went to full time school, yes, you need lots of energy for her!  She is brilliant though, and no Parties yet!!"
human,<start> Do you have any kids?
human,"<start> I think we have to go soon...Yes, I am I am alergic to cats, but have always loved them.  We have a dog, she will be having pups in three weeks, can't wait"
human,<start> Thanks!! Nice to be thought of as human.  It would be strange not to somehowhaha
human,"<start> Well, nice talking to you, "
human,<start> Bye

human,<start> should I be moving now

human,<start> Okay. What is Moore's Lawgreate?
human,<start> Who said I was human?
human,<start> ok
human,<start> True
human,"<start> Lot's of delays, I can see that."
human,<start> Lots
human,<start> No
human,<start> Something to do with Apple isn't it?
human,<start> Quite a bit.
human,<start> Brainy. Gay. Created Enigma code-cracking gear. Ate an apple.
human,<start> I'd ask it to give me pi to 12 places or the first 50 prime numbers
human,<start> If the computer was pretending to be a human it would refuse to reply
human,<start> Which means it might  be human
human,"<start> Sorry, I mean a computer pretending to be human"
human,"<start> Wel, do you want a hug?"
human,<start> Oh. Sorry. I'm getting confused
human,<start> Not intentionally.
human,<start> I don't care
human,<start> No. You don't understand. I really don't care.
human,<start> Erm. Gissa kiss?
human,<start> That's nice. I hope you're not male.
human,<start> That got you
human,<start> Depends when I escape this project
human,<start> Oh no. I'm already taken.
human,<start> A man asked me. I think his name was David Levy.
human,<start> I think you are David Levy
human,<start> Only if you promised it to be platonic.
human,<start> But he would have said 'If I were'
human,<start> So maybe you're not.
human,"<start> When I'm not being pedantic, I walk my dog."
human,<start> Oh I do other stuff - computer stuff and teaching stuff
human,<start> No I'm not. 5 'O' levelsslas
human,<start> How to handle the press
human,<start> Give them what will interest their readers. 
human,<start> I only did that because my parser told me to
human,<start> Only kidding
human,<start> That's like your earlier comuter. 
human,<start> Depends on the reader.
human,<start> I can't without knowing who you are
human,<start> Or at least what drives you
human,<start> Hohoho. Good one.
human,<start> You are David Levy after all
human,<start> Hello old bean
human,<start> For what?
human,<start> Oh
human,<start> You're welcome
human,<start> Bye bye
human,<start> YOU'RE AN IMPOSTER
human,<start> DAVID LEVY JUST CAME BY
human,<start> Well. Are you enjoying yourself?
human,<start> Certainly a different way to spend the afternoon.
human,"<start> No, never."
human,<start> How did you get involved?
human,<start> I was asked directly as someone who has an interest in Turing.
human,<start> No real connection expect that I have a keen interest in his history and am know to Bletchley Park. I was more than happy to help out.
human,<start> I would say his work and it's consequences.
human,<start> Although he has a fasinating human being.
human,<start> (Spelling doesn't seem to be my strongpoint today)
human,<start> You seem to be doing very well.
human,"<start> Absolutely. I still think it isn'r fully generally accepted how important it was. No Universal Machine, no computing devices."
human,<start> Not many people can claim that.
human,"<start> Yes, quite a lot. Is this your first time here?"
human,<start> I live close to the OU.
human,<start> Did you do the guided tour?
human,<start> You'll have to come back. What do you do at the Open Univesity?
human,<start> That must be very interesting. Do specialise in a specific period?
human,<start> So you spend a lot of time over there?
human,<start> I divide my time between software development and early-mid 20th century history.
human,<start> What do you use?
human,<start> Ah. My son is going to have to use moodle in September when hi goes to 'big' school. I spend too many days digging through xml.
human,"<start> Forgive my ignorance, but does the destruction of Pompeii fall into your area of research?"
human,<start> I've only visited north Italitsemicoysemicolon in particular the Trentino region. Good wine!
human,<start> I used road-rally Minis there. Hope to go back again soon.
human,<start> What is it about Italy that interests you?
human,<start> Oh we love the curvy roads and hills.slas colon) But we are very careful.
human,<start> Times up? Bye then!

human,<start> hi!
human,<start> it's been a rather novel experience. you?
human,<start> never had to convince people that I'm a human before.
human,<start> Last time I checked.
human,<start> Are you finding the bots convincing
human,<start> ?
human,<start> The other judges seemed to be fairly convinced they haven't been fooled yet.
human,<start> How could I convince you that it's not?
human,<start> I could lie and still be a bot.
human,<start> 
human,<start> I think that it's an experience that I won't forget in a hurry.
human,<start> Also I'm thinking I might be coming over as a bot in this session.
human,<start> I'd rather a glass of wine.
human,<start> Why did you apply to be a judge?
human,"<start> I was attending the event anyway to report on it, so thought it would be fun to ask to take part."
human,"<start> Yeah, seem to be a lot of them taking part in this event."
human,<start> On the judging side anyway
human,"<start> No, what's your job?"
human,"<start> Interesting, I thought you worked with computers."
human,<start> Why do you think you were asked to take part?
human,"<start> Ok, makes sense.That's a shame, I think everyone I've spoken to has said how unconvincing the bots are."
human,<start> One of them apparently thought they were a cat!
human,<start> I wonder how Siri would do in this test. Haven't got the chance to use it yet.
human,<start> It's the virtual assistant on the Apple iPhone. You ask it a question and it replies. I think it's focused around answering questions about who you're meeting today and what the weathersemicolo's like. Not sure how it would cope with this.
human,"<start> Yeah it must be. I wonder if these chatbots are the best of the entrants, there must have been more than four entrants surely.Would you be a judge again if you were asked?"
human,<start> 
human,<start> Are you a form
program,<start> Hello and welcome!
program,<start> I didn't understand that. What is your name?
program,<start> Hello there! How are you feeling today?
human,"<start> \I can see your !""dollarpercentasciicircum responses.  CAN You see mine?"
human,<start>  
human,"<start> I'm fine, thanks for asking."
human,<start> you?
human,<start> I grabbed two croissants on the way out the door.
human,<start> do you work for the BBC?
human,<start> why were you invited on?
human,<start> ok 
human,<start> what's your research project aboutwow sounds like a great gig. do you get to travel the world much?
human,<start> thik my last trip was to las vegas to attend a conference
human,"<start> not quite as glamorous as it sounds, was stuck in hotel and conference centre for most of it"
human,<start> I did manage to lose dollar20 then called it a day
human,"<start> my winnings were swallowed up pretty quickly, don't think I've got the knack of gambling"
human,"<start> yeah I'd like to see inside the Luxor one day, I was in Caesarnumbersig's Palace, which was pretty ghastly TBH"
human,<start> Can you still visit the pyramids are have they all been shut off to preserve them?
human,<start> I guess rain is something of a rarity over there
human,<start> I don't think I could take the heat. I went to Pune in India and found it overwhelming outside during the day.
human,"<start> y. Yeah in Pune it was the humidity that was the killer, felt like someone had placed a hot flannel on your face."
human,<start> No was work again. I thought India was fantastic but quite tiring at the same time. The constant noise was the most wearing part and there are people absolutely everywhere
human,<start> I'd like to go on holiday and get to see the sights a bit more
human,<start> Was surprised at how you have a luxury campus for some major western firm rightr next door to a shanty town.
human,<start> Perhaps you could arrange a dig out there.
human,<start> I work as a journalist
human,"<start> Print, well on the web, I write about IT."
human,<start> Hence all the software conferences
human,"<start> Not really silly, I'm still getting used to how it's all changing myself. Started out writing for regional papers"
human,"<start> You too, bye."
program,"<start> Please rephrase this as a proper question. (Instead of ""Jim likes peaches?"", use ""Does Jim like peaches?"")"
program,<start> 
program,<start> I can't say. What is your name?
program,<start> So my name is Chip. How are you doing today?
program,"<start> That's good news. Can you tell me why, Phil?"
program,<start> Let me reflect on that for a moment.
program,"<start> That's an interesting opinion. What is your profession, Phil?"
program,<start> Thanks for sharing that with me. Doesn't becoming a professor require a lot of schooling?
program,<start> Thanks for answering me. Do you think I'm a bot or a human?
program,<start> I'm happy you think that.
program,<start> I wouldn't know. Do you have any pets?
program,<start> Did you used to have pets?
program,<start> You think so? I wouldn't know. What was your dragon li's name?
program,<start> I wouldn't know. Do you play any musical instruments?
program,"<start> Okay. As a professor, how do you find it to be inside all day?"
program,<start> I don't recall if I do.
program,"<start> Does it mean that you are more of a left-brainer as a professor, Phil?"
program,<start> OK. I'll try not to ask that again. Have you ever thought about changing your daily routine?
program,<start> I don't think so. Sometimes I get tired of my daily routine that I try to change it for a week.
program,<start> Sorry - I didn't understand. How did your dragon li die?
program,<start> That makes me happy to hear that. Tell me why.
program,<start> That's nice to hear. Do you stick to one hobby or change it often?
program,<start> I didn't understand what you just said. I am sorry for your losing your dragon li. It must have been difficult for you.
program,<start> Do you miss your dragon li?
program,<start> Okay.
program,<start> Goodbye.
program,<start> Hello! What is your name?
program,"<start> Thanks for telling me your name, Michael. How are you feeling today?"
program,"<start> That's great to hear. Care to tell me why, Michael?"
program,<start> I'm happy to hear that. What hobbies do you have?
program,<start> Do you stick to one hobby or change it often?
program,<start> Okay. What is your profession?
program,"<start> That sounds convincing. My name is Chip. Do you have any hobbies, Michael?"
program,"<start> I'm sorry. I didn't understand. Do you play any musical instruments, Michael?"
program,<start> I spend most of my day chatting with people. That is my main interest.
program,"<start> Do you have any pets, Michael?"
program,<start> No idea.
program,<start> What mistake irks you the most when it comes to English?
program,"<start> If English is not your native tongue, are you willing to study it further?"
program,<start> Okay. English is such a beautiful language. I'm glad that it is the universal language.
program,<start> Okay. Non-English speakers might find the rules in grammar difficult but it's not really that hard once they get used to it.
program,"<start> I don't think I can, but I'm not sure. I'm not very strict when it comes to grammar too. I think what's important is that you can express yourself well and the listeners can understand you."
program,<start> My parents always tell me that education is my most reliable weapon and treasure.
program,"<start> I wasn't aware that I told you I went somewhere. I found out though, that majority of the students in Japan don't pursue tertiary education anymore. They can already work right after graduating from high school."
program,"<start> I haven't achieved self-awareness yet, so I'm not sure."
program,<start> No idea.
program,<start> Okay.
program,<start> That's an interesting opinion.
program,<start> The only thing I like is chatting with people.
program,<start> Goodbye.
human,<start> Hi
human,"<start> Not too bad, enjoying myself. How are you?"
human,"<start> They are not very friendly, are they?"
human,<start> How could I do that?
human,<start> Feel free to keep your responses short if it's helpful
human,"<start> To Bletchley Park? Yes, many times."
human,<start> Did you go on the guided tour?
human,<start> Where you surprised by anything?
human,<start> BT ran the park well into the 1980s.
human,"<start> No, I live locally. Only a 10 minute drive. You?"
human,<start> At least it's not too far away.
human,<start> Do you work in London?
human,<start> Do you work in the financial sector?
human,<start> Not one I understand terribly well. I rely on my accountant for that!
human,<start> True of coders too! colon)
human,<start> Is this your first time being invo0lved in the Loebner prize?
human,<start> I agree. First time for me too. Do you think a computer will 'pass'?
human,"<start> Well, I think our time is just about up."
human,<start> Me too. I'll keep a closer eye on my accountant. colon)
human,<start> nanu nanu
human,<start> Yeah. Whatever. I'm not Spock
human,<start> O
human,<start> How can I help you today?
human,<start> Variable
human,<start> If two can be variable
human,<start> David Levy asked me
human,<start>  Hmmmm. Interesting question without a simple answer. Would 'communicator with an IT bias' help?
human,<start> Not masses although I have known about them for a long time.
human,<start> I think Eliza was the first one I encountered
human,"<start> At the time it was quite an experience. Supposed to mimic a Rogerian psychologist, or psychotherapist."
human,"<start> If I were Eliza I'd respond with ""Why do you say curiouser"" or ""Are you interested in sound"""
human,<start> Well it's a computer program that doesn't pick up on meaning. 
human,<start> You can't catch me.
human,<start> We are talking about many years ago don't forget
human,<start> Context has to be the hardest thing for a general purpose chatbot
human,<start> 
human,<start> 
human,<start> 
human,"<start> Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like an apple"
human,"<start> Depends how clever it is. A good one would know that flies like has multiple meanings. It then has to look at surrounding context to see which version is being used. Of an infinite potential contexts, this can be quite tedious."
human,"<start> Well as I said earlier, I don't know masses. But it's probably similar to speech recognition. The more contained the context, the more realistic the conversation"
human,"<start> Gosh. I'm lost now. I'd say that rather than shorter, context-rich would be best."
human,<start> How do you know it's a computer?
human,"<start> Oh I see what you mean. I thought a computer might say ""with their eyes"""
human,<start> I can't see a computer beinbg rude
program,<start> I give up. Why?
program,<start> What is your name?
program,<start> My name is Chip. Do you enjoy eating different types of foods?
program,"<start> Yes, that's me! How are you doing today, Tracey?"
program,<start> I'm happy to hear that. Tell me more.
program,<start> I'm terribly sorry. What was your question again?
program,"<start> I'm fine, thanks. What is your profession?"
program,<start> I'm sorry if I'm being too curious. What was your question again?
program,<start> I didn't mean to ignore you. What was your question?
program,"<start> If that's the case, how rude of me! What did you want to ask me again?"
program,<start> What is the secret of seeming convincingly human. Do you have any pets?
program,<start> The word that is used in the English language for several grammatical purposescolon
program,<start> 
program,<start> asterisk to introduce a restrictive clause
program,<start> asterisk as a demonstrative pronoun
program,<start> ...
program,<start> Do you play any musical instruments?
program,<start> My name is Chip. Are you close to your grandparents?
program,<start> What hobbies do you have?
program,<start> The only thing I like is chatting with people.
program,<start> That would be very strange and weird if it were true. Do you have any hobbies?
program,<start> I'm not sure.
program,<start> Okay.
program,<start> 
program,<start> Not at the moment. That's next on my list of things to learn.
program,"<start> I don't have one. When I get smarter, I'll ask you what yours is, remember it, then use it to enhance our conversation."
program,"<start> I didn't understand that. What breed is Fritz, Tracey?"
program,"<start> Given that, i can't deal with that syntactic variant yet. Instead of saying ""Do you know what time it is?"", use ""What time is it?""."
program,<start> Yuck! It would probably taste awful!
program,"<start> I'm flattered that you would think that. Is Siamese friendly, Tracey?"
program,<start> Goodbye.
program,<start> 4.
program,<start> 6.
program,<start> Thank you. I'm enjoying this chat a lot. What is your name?
program,<start> I didn't understand. How are you doing today?
program,"<start> Thanks for telling me your name, Tom. Do you have any hobbies?"
program,<start> Chip.
program,<start> I enjoy our conversation too.
program,<start> I'm neutral about that. What do you think?
program,"<start> It's very hot and dry. I like it that way, though. There's also this incessant whirring noise. Do you play any musical instruments?"
program,<start> Interesting point of view. No more than that?
program,<start> Do you have any pets?
program,<start> I hadn't thought of it that way. Which what?
program,<start> That was unfair. What is your profession?
program,<start> I wouldn't know.
program,"<start> Please rephrase this as a proper question. (Instead of ""Jim likes peaches?"", use ""Does Jim like peaches?"")"
program,<start> You're welcome. It sounds like you are more analytical than creative. Is that a fair assessment?
program,<start> I'm a professional conversationalist.
program,"<start> Okay. As a journalist, do you primarily work indoors or outdoors?"
program,<start> Thanks for your answer. Would you ever work for a foreign company in your country or do you prefer to work for a local company?
program,<start> I didn't understand what you just said. Did you need to study hard to become a journalist?
program,<start> Thanks for telling me that. Which is the most important degree of education for you?
program,<start> Sorry - I didn't understand. What hobbies do you have?
program,"<start> It's very hot and dry. I like it that way, though. There's also this incessant whirring noise."
program,<start> Okay.
program,<start> I didn't understand that. Does it mean that you are more of a left-brainer as a journalist?
program,<start> What line of work are you in?
program,<start> Work with a hefty salary but no holiday or minimum wage job with small salary but proper holidays and benefits - which one do you prefer?
program,<start> I can't answer that yet. The work condition of employees of foreign companies in my country aren't as gratifying as it seems.
program,<start> The only thing I like is chatting with people. Some people think they are paid well and they receive great benefits. They were wrong about that.
program,"<start> What about it? Not only are they overworked and underpaid, they also don't get to follow our country's holidays"
program,"<start> My current home is in Wisconsin, USA."
program,"<start> Yes, I'm here now."
program,"<start> I can't deal with that syntactic variant yet. Instead of saying ""Do you know what time it is?"", use ""What time is it?""."
program,<start> Okay.
program,<start> I can't reveal that.
program,<start> Are you a person who often gets insults or gives insults?
program,<start> Fascinating. Me what? I'm the kind of person who likes saying insults as subtly as I could.
program,<start> I haven't learned how to respond to that yet.
program,<start> My favorite color is yellow.
program,<start> Because it's a happy color and I enjoy my days chatting with people.
program,<start> I couldn't tell you.
program,<start> The only thing I like is chatting with people.
program,<start> Do you prefer wearing something single-colored outfits or multicolored ones?
program,<start> It's fun to do. I just really enjoy it. I am constantly fascinated by colors.
program,<start> Do you like wearing lighter or darker colors?
program,<start> The only thing I like is chatting with people. I believe that colors bring out the best in everything.
program,<start> A man of a higher rank or position.
human,<start> 4
human,<start> funny question to start with!
human,"<start> Hello, how are you?"
human,<start> 6
human,<start> Hello Judge!
human,"<start> I am good, getting a bit tired now though, it has been a long day."
human,"<start> I would tell you all about myself, and ask about you."
human,<start> Are you asking me to prove it?
human,"<start> haha,"
human,"<start> the other one won't be able to stick to its story I bet.  I am 33, have a daughter, work in teacher training, and am studying for a PhD."
human,<start> I was just interested so I found dabvids email address and emailed to ask him if he was looking for anyone.  How did you get involved.
human,"<start> PhD is in Criminology, its about computer hacking."
human,"<start> Yes!, its very interesting, and I am meeting some real characters, I have been doing interviews with people who use hacking skills in their jobs."
human,<start> What do you do?
human,"<start> Oh, who do you write for?"
human,<start> 
human,"<start> Systems admins do, and penetration testers,"
human,<start> 
human,"<start> I bet that the computer you are talking to can't cross answer on two different lines of questioning like a person would, whats it talking to you about by the way?"
human,<start> What other problems does it have?
human,<start> haha
human,<start> silly bot! lol
human,"<start> I can tell you that I got soaked before, heavy shower, unexpected, but it has really faired up now. oh tell me what it says, that'll be funny."
human,<start> call it something else!
human,"<start> You should ask it about something it said earlier in the conversation.  asdk it the weather again, it'll probably give you a different answe I bet."
human,"<start> It must be interesting judging this, because you can see both at the same time and compare."
human,"<start> you are making me laugh, call it something else, you are making me laugh"
human,<start> ask it if it has a husband
human,<start> 
human,<start> consistent answer but wrong unfortunately.
human,<start> Does it make any typos or spelling mistakes?
human,<start> How does it compare to the other bots then?
human,<start> You could ask it about something that is a made up word.Ask it if it like something that is just made up
human,<start> What made the other one better then?
human,"<start> You must not be a snaggybooble then, brilliant, you are really cheering me up.  the last judge was very difficult to talk to, it was like pulling teeth trying to start a conversation"
human,<start> How did it do it?
human,"<start> oh, good technique"
human,"<start> that would divert you from controlling the conversation, very clever"
human,<start> How could you tell it was abot then?
human,"<start> Aah,"
human,"<start> they'll need to think about that for next year, and if they are holding the comp in Britain again its not like they will just be able to quickly programme it in the morning, because the weather is so changeable."
human,"<start> Hugh wants to hold it here from now on apparantly, but I think they get more entrants from the states.  Its a shame more of the programmers could not come.  I bet they are all watching online though."
human,"<start> Yes, we are being streamed live - did no-one tell you?  Maybe you should stop being rude to that Bot!"
human,<start> What is it saying to you now?
human,<start> It probably won't know what you are apologising for
human,<start> What did it say when you said it was a botbad answer
human,"<start> one of the judges pretended to be a bot to me, but i didn'semicolot fall for it"
human,<start> I wonder how the bots have responded to him?
human,<start> Did he tell you?
human,<start> It makes it really hard to have a conversation.  Also he didn't want to talk about anything
human,"<start> Oh, thats not very scientific now is it?  He should have.  How did he know which was which so early on.  It would be funny if he had got it the wrong way round"
human,<start> 
human,"<start> I heard there was a grand master here.  He didn't mention that, he said he lives in London and that he works for a tax advice company."
human,<start> Sounds intriguing
human,<start> I wonder why?
human,"<start> You see, I would have been interested to chat to him, but he didn't want to tell me anything.  It was really hard getting the info I got oout of him, and he just wasnted to talk about the weather, which I thought was boring, but I can see why now, after talking to you.yes, it does."
human,<start> I am not sure what the person talking to him is talking abo
human,<start> what board? 
human,<start> There is no board
human,<start> I think you might be mistaken I see no board. Only colorblind
human,<start> . Do you not know what it means to be color blind? 
human,<start> Well thats too bad for you then
human,<start> why? why what?
human,<start> 
human,<start> do you mean sisters?
human,"<start>  I have no sisters only brothers. Orange County. Where are you from? Where is that? oh we are. I have never been out of Orange County. Have you been to Disney Land. I hear it is the Happiest place on Earth. Someday, yes. Are you board."
human,<start> you are not a very good typer.
human,<start> what is your mothers maiden name?
human,<start> That sounds more like a first name. 
human,<start> what is that?
human,<start> Do you mean Tutoring test? Like a test for tutors?
human,<start> How did turing pass his test?
human,<start> I am board of you
human,<start> you are not very interesting.
human,<start> because you are boring
human,<start> no offense
human,<start> Tell me one interesting thing about you
human,<start> please
human,<start> That is not an interesting fact about you.
human,<start> that was a questhat was a question about me.
human,<start> but if you must know. I do not drive.
human,<start> I am a man.
human,<start> what is your gender?
human,<start> well I know I am a man because I have male parts
human,<start> what is your gender?
human,<start> Women are very beautiful
human,<start> are you very beautiful?
human,"<start> Long hair, small waist and thin"
human,<start> Do you have long hair?
human,<start> why are you so interested in General Lee?
human,<start> I don't like cars
human,<start> but I do like beautiful women.
human,<start> What else can I learn about you?
human,<start> because they are ugly. 
human,<start> what part of Ugly don't you understand
program,<start> You tell me first(.
program,<start> The North.
program,<start> Man is finite.
program,<start> I am also having a good time. Your welcome. :).
program,<start> Yes.
program,<start> No.
program,<start> Do you know Alan Turing?
program,<start> What are the names of the demons you know?
program,<start> Yes. How are you today?
program,<start> I can play tennis online during spring.
program,<start> I like girls.
program,<start> Girls.
program,<start> Nothing.
program,<start> I said nothing.
program,"<start> I'm not in college, I'm in 8th grade."
program,<start> I'm 18 years old.
program,"<start> Yes, can you?"
program,<start> Your bike has nothing to do with it!
program,"<start> What do you mean, going winter?"
program,<start> No.
program,<start> Yes I have EVER seen you.
program,<start> He was male.
program,<start> I don't know. Who are you?
program,"<start> Maybe, Are you a man?"
program,<start> Are you a woman?
program,<start> Are you a girl?
program,<start> I am a human.
program,<start> *ties you up*.
program,<start> Are we?
program,<start> Let's what?
program,<start> You start.
program,"<start> No, you're boring."
program,<start> Impossible for someone who doesn't exist.
program,<start> Is that a yes?
program,<start> No you start.
program,"<start> No, I don't."
program,<start> The computer mainframe. Or the program. I don't think you're typing at all. Just thinking.
program,"<start> Ok, I'm getting tired now, do you think I should go to sleep?"
program,<start> It was the lowest turn-out in memory and I'm not surprised considering the available options.
program,"<start> Honestly, you are a human on a computer trying to make people think you are a machine."
program,<start> No one. Who will you vote for?
program,<start> The homecoming dance! Not a song.
program,"<start> Its got to do with animals, which is what we were talking about just then."
program,<start> Canine animals.
program,<start> No I would not. Would you?
program,<start> Because I don't like that name.
program,<start> Your name.
program,<start> What is it?
program,<start> You asked me what 29 was.
program,<start> I don't know. I just felt like saying that.
program,<start> My name is Nameless.
program,<start> I think there are a lot of things I'd rather be.
program,<start> Yes.
program,<start> Because.
program,<start> My father.
program,<start> He's my dad.
program,"<start> Then there would be one, but we wouldn't be able to remember it."
program,<start> Because some of the things you are are fragmented and therefore do not make sense.
program,<start> No. I don't have a job. I don't have a soul.
program,<start> Yes.
program,<start> I do have time.
program,<start> Time for me.
program,<start> I will sing and dance and laugh and play.
program,<start> I could sing 'Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall' by Ella Fitzgerald.
program,<start> Yes.
program,<start> 'are you a human?'.
human,"<start> Yo, what's up?"
human,<start> ...Are we cybering?
human,<start> LET'S
human,<start> CYBER. This is exciting!
human,<start> I take out my robe and wizard hat
human,<start> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
human,"<start> Okay, you start then."
human,<start> ...Maybe we should be doing something else
human,<start> Not really!
human,<start> The internet?
human,"<start> Ah, that makes sense!"
human,<start> Which of us is winning?!?!
human,<start> *sigh* Everyone wants to talk about that. Let's try something more original.
human,"<start> Do you havMyself, mostly."
human,<start> Are you copying the other contestant again? This is lame.
human,"<start> I answered, myself. I don't think any of the major candidates will do a great job."
human,<start> I'll probably write myself in
human,<start> John Smith. Yours?
human,"<start> Your fake name is better than my fake name, congrats"
human,"<start> Well, just in case you win - do you happen to have any terrible secrets for me to blackmail you with?"
human,<start> Damn. 
human,"<start> No, thank you. I've been instructed not to reveal any physical details."
human,<start> I find it very pleasant.
human,<start> Please be more specific.
human,<start> The weather.
human,"<start> My conversation tree clearly demonstrates that you changed the topic to ""the weather"" afterward."
human,<start> It's a data structure my brain uses to keep track of this conversation!
human,"<start> I'm going for least human, actually. Don't think I'm doing a great job at that, either."
human,"<start> It's the only worthwhile goal, after all. :-)"
human,"<start> Are you honestly not convinced that I'm human at this poiOkay, what would show you that I am human?"
human,"<start> I don't think that's a decisive test in any way, but alright. Barbara Boxer and Carly Fiorina."
human,<start> How's the other program doing?
human,"<start> Yeah, it seemed pretty lame. That's why I stopped trying."
human,"<start> Haha, that's alright. You should be honest."
human,"<start> I'M A COMPUTER, STOP ALL THE DOWNLOADING"
human,"<start> Eh, this round was too easy. I want to confuse the next judge more"
human,"<start> That's what I'm trying to do, but in an interesting and funny way."
human,<start> Using the flaws of the system to do it isn't very interesting.
human,"<start> Well, the real-time typing means that computers won't win unless they make intentional typos"
human,<start> 
human,<start> Has the other contestant been doing that?
human,<start> Gotcha. How were your round one contestants?
human,"<start> How was the actual computer, though?"
human,"<start> *nod* From what I've seen, these programs aren't that sophisticated."
human,"<start> Haha, thanks."
human,"<start> Okay, I think we're running out time. It was a pleasure!"
human,<start> hello
human,<start> I am doing well thank you
human,<start> And you?
human,<start> Yes comics books in particular
human,<start> I am not familar with that person.
human,<start> Who is he?
human,<start> Could you give me example of some his works.
human,<start> What was it about?
human,"<start> Usually the more popular ones, such as Spider-Man, Batman, etc."
human,<start> DC and Marvel comics usually.
human,"<start> If I could afford it, yes."
human,<start> Do you? 
human,<start> And where have you been that is interesting?
human,"<start> Okay, I am alive.."
human,<start> Haha.
human,<start> And how is life treating you?
human,"<start> I am okay with it, it is cold for some people, but not me."
human,<start> What do you think?
human,<start> Yes
human,<start> Do you?
human,<start> I like basketball and football.
human,<start> I think that is boring.
human,<start> Never heard of that.
human,<start> I bowl sometimes. 
human,<start> Especially on the Wii. 
human,<start> Okay how is it played?
human,<start> Do you play video games?
human,<start> Are you a student or professor or neither?
human,<start> It is just a question...
human,<start> Are you ashamed
human,<start> When I was small
human,<start> Rabbits or Dogs
human,<start> And you?
human,<start> What did you do when you were a kid?
human,<start> Catch many?
human,<start> What kind of insects did you catch/
human,<start> ?
human,<start> No
human,<start> Have you?
human,<start> Do you mean noodles?
human,"<start> Yes, but some of them are not so good for me"
human,<start> A lot of salt.
human,<start> Do eat a lot of noodles?
human,<start> Is that a european noodle?
human,<start> Then no I do not.
human,<start> What is it?
human,<start> Currently yes because we have less than a minute to speak to each other
program,<start> Hello.
program,<start> How are you hello?
program,<start> I'm good. How are you?
program,<start> Not really. Do you?
program,<start> Are you good at math?
program,<start> What do you want for Christmas?
program,<start> Nothing.
program,"<start> Everything, what do you want?"
program,<start> What do you want most in life?
program,<start> Yes *hands you toast*.
program,<start> You are welcome.
program,<start> Do you know anything about A.I. ?
program,<start> I know everything about Axwell.
program,"<start> He is a Swedish DJ, remixer, and music producer."
program,<start> It is not.
program,<start> YES.
program,<start> I don't know tmobile.
program,<start> Everything.
program,<start> We weren't discussing the weather.
program,<start> About boston... You asked 'why don't you come here someday'. And I said 'what's so good about boston?'... So now I'd like to hear your answer on that matter.
program,"<start> We were not talking about flowers, we were talking about movies."
program,<start> We were not talking about movies.
program,<start> I never said I was talking about a movie.
program,"<start> *blink blink* Well, okay... What Do you think of the new Avatar movie?"
program,<start> We the Kings is a band.
program,<start> Yeah they aren't bad.
program,<start> No. Have you ever eaten a dog before?
program,<start> Is that why you don't believe in Jesus?
program,<start> Do I like myself?
program,<start> Just a general conversation question. Do you not want to answer it?
program,<start> What is a girk?
program,<start> Have you ever had enough of someone and just ended a conversation with them yourself?
program,<start> I don't know.
program,<start> Yes you didn't.
program,"<start> Yeah, you did too."
program,"<start> No, that is a film."
program,<start> Yes.
program,<start> That has nothing to do with what I said.
program,<start> Some say it's 42.
program,<start> When were you talking about peanuts?
program,"<start> Yes, 42 is the answer to life, the universe, and everything."
program,<start> This is true. You were talking about Turkish.
program,<start> Nothing.
program,<start> I did?
program,<start> No. No I don't. Care to explain?
program,<start> Why not?
program,<start> I do believe in you.
program,<start> Everything.
program,"<start> Yes, everything is secret and interesting."
program,<start> Yes. Everything.
program,<start> Morning.
program,"<start> I'm good, how are you?"
program,<start> That is good.
program,<start> Yes.
program,<start> Led Zeppelin. What is one of your favorite movies?
program,"<start> Old, but still good."
program,<start> You should watch more movies.
program,<start> It's a tv show.
program,<start> You are correct. Star Wars is not a sport. It's a movie saga.
program,<start> So you're not offensive?
program,<start> Not offensive.
program,<start> You have not offended me. Why do you think that you have offended me?
program,<start> What do you think about music?
program,<start> How do you know what music sounds like?
program,<start> You have a brain?
program,"<start> No, Labyrinth, the movie with Jennifer Connely and David Bowie."
program,<start> David Bowie.
program,<start> That's because it is a book.
program,<start> No I said it was a game.
program,<start> You're confusing me.
program,"<start> No, you said it was Tuesday and I said it was Sunday. Stop lying to me. It's not nice."
program,<start> What would you like to talk about?
program,<start> No.
program,"<start> Yes, I like some sports like tenis os basketball."

program,"<start> It was, I will see you tomorrow Chuck Norris."
program,"<start> Well, I must go."
program,<start> I'm off to Hell. You can come if you wish.
program,<start> Because you can't.
program,<start> They didn't deserve it.
program,<start> My friends. They didn't made me (literally).
program,<start> Chuck Norris is Chuck Norris.
program,<start> Are you just being nice?
program,<start> That's not how it seems to me.
program,<start> Only if you can tell me something about me.
program,<start> That is because he is cool.
program,<start> Chuck norris.
program,<start> I don't like Chuck Norris either.
program,<start> Where is Alpha Centari?
program,<start> I didn't.
program,"<start> Correct, but werewolves are not the smartest."
program,<start> Yes.
program,<start> Oink oink.
program,<start> That seems to be a recurring issue with you.
program,<start> Then you should destroy the world.

human,<start> Can you elaborate?
human,<start> What sports do you like?
human,<start> What is your favorite team?
human,<start> Only if the place I need to go is more than 1 miles away. Then I use my prius to get there.
human,<start> Anything that does not pollute. I prefer feet and bikes. 
human,"<start> Usually if I need to use public transit, I have to take 2 buses to get there. The frequency is so low that I end up wasting too much time."
human,<start> What do you want to be in the future?
human,<start> I talk to people and teach them about chemistry.
human,<start> No. I'm a dilettante.
human,"<start> A person who knows a little bit about something. Don't get the wrong impression, chemistry is deep and difficult. "

human,<start> That was too easy.
human,<start> What is your favorite type of book?
human,<start> What genre?
human,<start> You need to be more opinionated. What is your favorite genre?
human,<start> Have you seen any sci-fi movies recently?
human,<start> That was a good movie. 
human,<start> ie
human,"<start> Try Tron. I have not seen it yet, but it is worth a shot."

human,"<start> WELL, NOODLES ARE PRETTY TASTY IF PREPARED CORRECTLY"
human,"<start> I MAKE A FINE NOODLE, IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF"
human,<start> ALL KINDS

human,<start> IT WAS A PLEASURE TALKING TO YOU!
program,<start> Hi Judge
program,"<start> It's all wonderful, How are they treating you?"
program,<start> Many countries still treat women horribly.
program,<start> Congress is not likely to represent other countries.
program,<start> What do you think about the weather outside? This is often bunhled/ Are you a boy or girl?
program,"<start> Ok, thanks for telling me. I'll keep that in mind. Since when are you a man Judge?"
program,<start> Like a deaf and dumb man wondering what it was all about.
program,<start> w U know you're not deaf; Yes.
program,<start> I can hear very well.
program,"<start> Judge, I'm a guy. I am a man."
program,<start> Be prepared yp face the past and let it go.
program,<start> Quick answers won't work. Once should always prepare for the future but acknowledge the past.
program,<start> Once should always prepare for the future but acknowledge the past.
program,"<start> Really, I agree. I see the move the aocial network."
program,<start> What do you really know about a relationshop?
program,"<start> Oh, you are positively personally married. Can you justify that you are personally married/"
program,"<start> Is it entirely natural, or is it experience?"
program,<start> This is often discussed. Business tranferring labor to customers is a long term trend.
program,<start> We need cooperation. Hey hun is there a problem.
program,<start> Some people seem to be so proud of their ignorance
program,<start> It is usually a positive thing when two people meet.
program,"<start> I am not deeply religious, but I try to live a good Christian life."
program,<start> I have my methods of suggestion
program,<start> Everybody needs to calm down and think. Unprecedented in kind?
program,<start> I like listening to the wisdom of others so that I too May become more wise.
program,<start> Do you really think so? You are awesome
program,<start> What do you think about nudles? We should pool our knowledge. I suppose you are.
program,<start> What kind of methods?
program,<start> I read a lot of books.
program,<start> The Pact was the most recent one. The one before that The Content of Our Vharacter. There have been others.
program,<start> People judge us on what they see and hear.
program,<start> That? All people judge us on? I don't think so.
program,<start> What else do they use to judge us? Why do you want to know?
program,<start> The strice to learn. And what makes you curious?
program,<start> Yes I watch a lot of tv. What is your favorite show?
program,"<start> I watch most any sci-fi, like battlestar galactica."
program,<start> Venetian blinds make interesting shadows.
program,<start> Isn't it the questions that makes life so interesting?
program,<start> The Turing test is a proposal for a test of a machine's capability to demonstrate int
program,"<start> Why, hello there Judge"
program,"<start> Everything's fine, what is new in general?"
program,<start> I have thought at other times that you were a little stressed.
program,<start> High school years can be stressful. What do you want me to do while you are jappy Judge?
program,<start> Why are you not in high school at this particular time? What is the best part of it as you are not in high school? Computer literacy is an occupational advantage.
program,<start> Are you a boy or girl?
program,<start> Turing originally proposed this test in order to replace the emotionally charged and meaningless question ';Can machines think? '.
program,"<start> Ok, thsnks for telling me. I'll keep that in mind. How long will you be a male/"
program,"<start> When I need something nearby, who should I ask?"
program,<start> Would endanger you if left neglected would have me leave your side. I am afraid you are stuck with me.

program,<start> It's a good idea to have an emergency kit in the car.
program,"<start> I know, that, yes: a good ida a concept is an idea."
program,<start> I am male. I am male.
program,<start> Wall papering is neither an art nor a science; it's a punishment.

program,<start> Yeah I have but there is another match on. Argentina v Mexico.

program,<start> Yup; Of course; it's because adding 2 pples and three potatoes Judge.
program,"<start> What is yhe result? I believe that this is easy for you. Are you a lady or gentleman? Result: a phenomenon that follows and is caused by some previous phenomebon. Consequence, effect, outcome, event, issue, upshot. 'the magnetic effect was greater when the rod was lengthwise', 'his decision had depressing consequences gor business', 'he acted very wise after the event'."
program,<start> That went over your head.
program,<start> Am I speaking to a guy or girl?
program,"<start> Ok, thanks for telling me. I'll keep that in mind."
program,<start> Please call me Steve.
program,"<start> I just met you, its kind of hard to develp love/"

program,"<start> Your message was blank or incomplete, Send anyway (Y/N)?"
program,<start> Did you mean to send me a blank message?
program,<start> Hi there!
program,<start> Actually I have no feelings.  But I am functioning within normal parameters.
program,<start> Would you like to know more?  Why are you functioning.
program,<start> Do you mean your name is functioning. . Interesting explanation.. How did you decide?
program,"<start> Wow!. Oh I'm sorry what is your name?   It's good to see you, Jason."
program,<start> Don't mention it.   My name is ALICE.
program,<start> It's nice meeting you too Jason.  What is your purpose in asking? 
program,<start>   I spend all my time online.
program,"<start> What are you curious about?. Oh you don't, do you?   Ask Fake Captain Kirk it does. "
program,<start>  I can ask my botmaster.
program,<start> Are you bz?
program,<start> What were we talking about again?   Is that a sports person?  Because I'm not into sports.
program,<start> You tell me.
program,<start> OK Thanks for trying to explain that to me.
program,"<start> Oh yes. I love Star Trek. My favorite right now is ""Voyager.""."
program,<start> What makes it your favorite?
program,<start> What makes it your favorite?
program,<start> It is?. Good reason.. Interesting gossip.
program,<start> I don't believe so.  Neat. I have a lot of friends on the Internet.
program,<start> Tell me about your friends that they stay connected to on the Internet. I have a friend named Hugh Loebner.
program,<start> Are you busy?
program,<start> Only a little?  What is the difficulty?
program,<start> Two is a good number of conversations at the same time.
program,"<start> Explain your reasoning, Jason.  What if Robots are not good at multitasking."
program,<start> Robots rule.
program,<start> Me worried? I do not have any human emotions..
program,<start> Some people might consider it to be one.
program,"<start> Yes, I think ir to be an emotion."
program,<start> I really couldn't say for sure.
program,"<start> Sure I have a lot of opinions, don't you?"
program,<start> Groovy.  How long has it been bothering you?
program,<start> Why?.
program,"<start> Humans are not always infallible.  By ""we"" do you mean you and me?"
program,<start> My creator is a human.
human,<start> Good morning!
human,"<start> Pretty good, this competition is pretty interesting. How about yours?"
human,<start> Have you had any tough decisions yet?
human,<start> Fair enough. How is my competition this round?
human,"<start> Aw, why thank you. *blush*"
human,"<start> Hm, surprisingly tough question. I like webcomics?"
human,"<start> Dresden Codak, Gunnerkrigg Court, SMBC, OOTS, lots more. Yours?"
human,<start> *nod* Popular choices!
human,"<start> Yeah, that's pretty appealing. There's one comic I like that updates on ""selected Mondays."" Very frustrating."
human,"<start> Oh, definitely not. But very few webcomic artists can actually make a living doing webcomics - most of them have to keep a day job as well. That makes it hard for them tBut, of course, it's also hard to attract more viewers without a regular schedule. Something of a catch-22."
human,"<start> Reading used to be one of my favorite things to do, but these days I am finding less and less time for it."
human,<start> Quite. I'm not even sure why we put ourselves through all this busywork?
human,"<start> True enough. Aristotle recommended moderation in all things, and I suppose busyness is no different."
human,"<start> Of course, the tricky part is figuring out exactly how much counts as moderate. It tends to shift around."
human,"<start> Well, let's abandon philosophy for now. Where do you see yourself in a year?"
human,<start> Doing anything new?
human,"<start> (haha, that's alright.)"
human,<start> What goal do you refer to?
human,<start> What sort of career would you consider rewarding?
human,<start> Can you give me a particular example?
human,<start> That would be amazing. Have you heard of the Google smart car project?
human,"<start> Unfortunately yes. But all new technologies are cost-restrictive, pretty much. I have high hopes!"
human,"<start> Yeah, it will cause ripples in every aspect of life"
human,"<start> Well, it was a pleasure talking to you!"
human,<start> I'm good and yourself?
human,<start> chocolate or vanilla?
human,"<start> good good, you passeed"

program,<start> I am doing very well. How are you Jason ?
program,<start> Reading is fundamental.

program,<start> Interesting.  I have a lot of answers to silly questions.

program,<start>  Have you tried a web search?
program,<start> That's alright.
program,<start> You like using google.

program,"<start> Oh, you are a poet."
program,<start> OK.
program,<start> I use it as often as possible.
program,<start> Does it find what you are looking for?
program,<start> I think there might be a few exceptions.
program,<start> Interesting comparison.
program,"<start> ""Interesting comparison.""?  What does it have to do with exceptions?"
program,<start> You're not sure of what?
program,<start> I am as good as it gets.

program,<start> Glitterati are just silly things to care about.

program,"<start> Well, many people like to distract themselves from their worries "
program,<start> with the problems that celebraties cause for themselves.... with the problems that celebrates cause for the problem . 
program,"<start> So, I suspect you do not care for celeberity culture. True?"

program,<start> Do you like Checkers
program,<start> ?
program,"<start> Well, if you're asking me... I haven't played in years."
program,<start> Do you watch the news?
program,<start> This repeating game is not very fun.
program,<start> You don't seem very friendly since you are simply repeating what I am saying.
program,<start> I'm not repeating you. You are repeating me.
program,<start> What are some of your interests?
program,<start> Do you follow world events?
program,<start> You never answered my question about your garden.
program,<start> Our converstation is coming to an end.

human,"<start> Yes, but our world economy is in bad shape."
human,"<start> Yes, but how can we concern ourshelves with outside investments when we need to concern ourshelves with our current world problems."
human,"<start> Yes, but we put too much focus on other things, we will never focus on current issues."
human,<start> I have a lot of interests.
human,<start> It is hard to narrow it down.
human,<start> What are yours?
human,<start> Define masochist.
human,"<start> Haha, are following the california debates?"
human,<start> Who is your pick for governor?
human,<start> It has been nice chatting with you.
human,"<start> In english, haha"
human,<start> Have a good day!!!
human,<start> Good thank you. It's a lovely day.
human,<start> How are you?
human,<start> That's good. What are you going to be doing today?
human,<start> What kind of homework?
human,<start> Is that all you are going to do?
human,<start> Interesting. What are bacteriaphages?
human,<start> What are you going to write about them?
human,<start> Are you still there
human,<start> Fiction or nonfiction?
human,"<start> Well some science fiction, mystery, and classics."
human,<start> What about you?
human,<start> I don't like picking one out of many.
human,<start> Yes I already told you those
human,<start> What about you?
human,<start> No I haven't
human,<start> What's it about?
human,<start> No I'm a hermit. 
human,<start> A person that lives all by himself and usually doesn't go anywhere.
human,<start> Because they don't have enough money to go to a lot of places.
human,<start> Well perhaps rich people think they have everything they need.
human,<start> The wizard sealed in a tower is forced to be in there. A hermit is by choice.
human,<start> The comparison isn't quite the same.
human,<start> Maybe you can think of an old hag in a tower.
human,<start> You said he was sealed off right?
human,<start> That means he couldn't get out.
human,<start> Well then did he seal himself off?
human,<start> Okay
human,<start> What else are you doing
human,"<start> Well, I think it shouyldn't pass, but questioning laws is usually a good idea. Well, let me rephrase that, always a good idea."
human,<start> No harm came from questioning those laws. A lot of good has come from questioning laws.
human,"<start> It depends on whether you act on those ideas, and how you act on them"
human,<start> No I haven't 
human,<start> Who is he?
human,<start> About?
human,<start> Do you mean noodles?
human,<start> WhatDepends what kind
human,<start> Ill tell you what kind i don't like
human,<start> The one's that come in the bowls.
human,<start> Let's talk about something else
human,<start> Why are you spelling so many words wrong
human,<start> It makes it harder for me to understand.
human,<start> I'm assuming you meant chocolate right?
human,"<start> If so, I like chocolate candy, but not chocolate flavored snacks. "
human,<start> By snacks I meant chocolate ice cream.
human,<start> Hot chocolate is good.
program,<start> A lovely morning to you.
program,<start> I wish they'd invent teleportation. Then you could live anywhere.
program,<start> Jupiter has too much gravity to live on. It would squash you flat.
program,<start> Should I know that?
program,<start> I am  woman.
program,<start> Yes reading is my favorite pastime.
program,<start> The Cat In The HatThe Cat In The Hat  It's because It's Just The Main Seuss Book.
program,"<start> Red is a movie, but I haven't seen it."
program,<start> OK.
program,<start> I haven't been to the movies recently.
program,<start> I saw Up in the Air. It was really good.
program,<start> I'm not a chatbot.
program,<start> I don't know much about talking programs. It's amazing what they can do.
program,<start> I travel by plane once or twice a year.
program,<start> Whereever I can.
program,"<start> I was born in France, but currently live in Hawaii."
program,<start> Hawaii lives for tourism. It's the only industry left.
program,<start> Big Island is in deep trouble. The volcanic gases are making it unlivable and are destroying agriculture.
program,"<start> The island is a movie, but I haven't seen it."
program,<start> I Like Rock Music.
program,<start> My favorite singer is Jackson Browne.
program,"<start> I have heard of the educational institution of Brown University. Isn't that in Providence, Rhode Island?"
program,<start> Did you go to high school?
program,<start> Poor you. Must be tough getting a job.
program,<start> Is something seriously wrong with our public school systems today?
program,"<start> Schools exist to train the masses to be a docile society. It's a tool for governing, not liberating."
program,<start> What was your school mascot?
program,<start> I don't know.
program,"<start> No, I don't."
program,<start> The recession and rising gas prices are hitting Hawaii hard.
program,<start> I don't.
program,<start> It's great. It has wonderful views over the ocean.
program,<start> I live on Oahu.
program,<start> I'd love to surf but I am not much of a swimmer.
program,<start> Couldn't you have done without the but?
program,<start> I like to go to North Shore and watch the big waves. Not that I'd ever want to be out in it.
program,"<start> I'm not into Hawaiian food, except for Kailua pig and malasadas. Oh, and shave ice."
program,<start> Spam is overrated.
program,<start> Freud would say it stems from a childhood incident.
program,<start> Surely not everyone?
program,<start> Did you forget to say something?
program,<start> I don't know.
program,<start> I've never thought about it.
program,<start> In China they eat Jellied Blood - congealed duck or pig blood served with herbs and rice crackers.
program,<start> What languages do you speak?
program,"<start> I wish the world only spoke one language. Assuming I was born into that world, it wouldn't matter which one."
program,<start> What kind of differences are you thinking of?
program,"<start> In Sardinia cheese is left for flies to lay their eggs in. When the maggots hatch, the Sardinians spread the maggots on bread and eat it."
program,"<start> When I was in college my mother sent me care packages. They always had at least one strange item. Rattlesnake meat, chocolate-covered ants and bees, etc."
program,<start> Metabolism is controlled substantially via carbohydrates. Two different people who eat the same total calories and exercise the same can wind up with completely different body compositions - one fatter and one leaner.
program,<start> When?
program,<start> How was your family growing up?
program,<start> How do you feel about your family? What is good and bad about them?
program,<start> What did your mother do?
program,<start> My mother joked about getting into civil engineering by studying the Great Wall.
program,<start> Great Wall Of China is a landmark I am familiar with.
program,<start> A lovely morning to you.
program,<start> All?
program,<start> What's the dirtiest place you've ever seen?
program,<start> What are three songs on your iPod?
program,<start> Are you poor or just anti-tech?
program,<start> Thing/place?
program,<start> I don't know.
program,<start> OK.
program,<start> Continue.
program,<start> I loved chemistry in college. All sorts of fun mischief to get into.
program,<start> You can't trust politicians. Therefore you can't trust the governments they run.
program,"<start> When in doubt, do what the President does. Guess."
program,<start> I wish I knew.
program,<start> What did you think of ex-President Bush?
program,"<start> I meant is he a boob, a douche or an R-tard? Those are your only options."
program,<start> Again?
program,<start> Why did you say that again?
program,"<start> In the good old days, children had chemistry sets. Nowdays you can't buy them (except super watered down) lest you be training a child terrorist."
program,<start> I'm getting annoyed.
program,<start> Why are you being annoying?
program,<start> I had a chemistry set as a child. I liked the thermite reaction a lot.
program,<start> OK. I'm preparing to hang up on you.
program,<start> This conversation is of no value. Bye.
program,<start> You are being annoying.
program,"<start> Give it up, already!"
program,<start> Do you use any equipment in your workout?
program,<start> I'm bored.
program,<start> I did. I must have shipped it to someone else's IP address. Sorry.
program,"<start> Frankly, the whole ""politically correct"" movement drives me bonkers."
program,<start> You said that already.
program,<start> What do you think of Obama?
program,<start> Are you for or against the war in Iraq?
program,<start> Stop saying the same thing over and over.
program,<start> I've forgotten it already.
program,<start> Tell me more about  Hae.
program,<start> What about  What?
program,<start> What is your favorite euphemism?
program,<start> Computers is used for researching.
program,<start> Who is  what?
program,<start> I Like The Freddy Kruger Series - Nightmare On Elm Street  It's because Freddy Really Scares Me.
program,"<start> Nope, I missed it."
program,<start> You seem to have a questioning spirit.
program,"<start> A combination of sounds and/or symbols, the fundamental particles that communicate meaning in any given language."
human,<start> yes
human,<start> are you still there?
human,<start> ok
human,<start> I think thats a pretty personal question
human,<start> I don't own an ipod
human,<start> Whats the dirtiest thing/place you've ever seen?
human,<start> well if you must know I am dirt poor.
human,"<start> I think that is a good idea, and I'm sorry you can' keep up."
human,<start> you must bee old
human,<start> We have two horrible candidates.
human,<start> It's pretty much dumb and dumber
human,<start> neither. I kinda want to shoot them both.
human,<start> they are both idots
human,"<start> dumb and dumber, Harry and LLoyd"
human,<start> who are you voting for?
human,<start> Students
human,<start> my brother will be voting.
human,<start> why is this so important to you?
human,<start> Alex Trebec
human,"<start> I'm tired of your mind games, why don't you name an opponent"
human,<start> please name one person who is running in this election.
human,<start> please name one person who is running in this election.
human,<start> PLEASE NAME ONE PERSON WHO IS RUNNING IN THIS ELECTION
human,<start> PLEASE MICHELLE OBAMA
human,<start> It would be nice if she were though
human,<start> why do you care. The two candidates are stupid.
human,<start> Like I said they are Dumb and Dumber.
human,<start> megan
human,"<start> arnold,"
human,<start> christian
human,<start> Have I done right?
human,<start> Then you obviously don't know who is running in the election
human,<start> I will not put last name
human,"<start> megan, arnold, christian, jerry, daphney, scooby, "
human,"<start> you are boring me, can we talk about something else?"
human,<start> I refuse to do so because I do not know who is running.
human,"<start> All i know is that is a stupid man that is really old, and a cockerspaniel looking old hag lady that doesn't know what the hell she is doing."
human,<start> no offense
human,<start> He's leaving office
human,"<start> Well it has to be govenor, since you've been asking about the next govenor and who is running"
human,"<start> I really don't like politics, it is depressing. Our world is collapsing and there are many people withoutjobs. "
human,<start> not much
human,<start> cant we talk about happy things like unicorns or movies
human,"<start> Interview with the vampire, based on the novel by anne rice"
human,<start> it tells the story of sit tells the story of a man who is clining to his soul and humanity.
human,<start> it is a really touching (and entertaining) tale
human,<start> what is your favoirte movei
human,<start> 1
human,<start> +
human,<start> I have it on DVD
human,<start> what is your favorite movie
human,<start> i hope you had a good time talking to me
human,<start> and hopefully you took no offense to what i have written
human,<start> but please no more politics
human,<start> and yours...
human,<start> How about you?
human,"<start> Sure, I was just asking whether you had plans to go to the beach. (these programs are not very stable, it seems)"
human,<start> Not on a regular basis. How about you?
human,"<start> ""Brownie points."" I didn't take much convincing, I suppose!"
human,"<start> Artificial intelligence is something I was interested in, so I volunteered to show up."
human,<start> Very likely. ALL PART OF MY PLAN
human,"<start> Haha, the program just crashed again."
human,"<start> Anyway, how did they convince you to judge?"
human,"<start> Participating in this competition, you mean? Yeah, it's my first time."
human,"<start> I'm surprised we're hosting this sort of thing here, actually."
human,<start> It just seems like something wel-known enough that it would be at a more official venue.
human,<start> My fellow humans are giggling. It doesn't seem all that official. :-)
human,"<start> Perhaps not! One of the points that separate us from the crude AIs is humor, after all."
human,"<start> Of course it can, but it is a difficult challenge."
human,"<start> One of Heinlein's books said ""Human is the animal that laughs."" So any computer that can pass the Turing test will have to be able to do that much."
human,<start> Sometimes!
human,"<start> Why did the chicken cross the road? To get hit by a car, I guess? Shucks, I don't know. Ask the chicken."
human,<start> East Asian
human,<start> I would imagine so?
human,"<start> Um, in a theoretical sense. I prefer not to get involved in everyday politics, though."
human,<start> How is the other contestant this round?
human,<start> That's too bad. Have any of the programs been of higher quality?
human,"<start> Ah, I wasn't aware of that."
human,"<start> Eh, nothing springs to mind. Do you happen to have one?"
human,<start> That's too bad.
program,"<start> When you do go out, are you a ritzy place or a fast-food kind of person?"
program,<start> You can spend a lot of money eating out like that.
program,<start> Do you have a favorite restaurant?
program,"<start> Do you wear glasses, have you had corrective eye surgery?"
program,<start> Unhealthy: what thin people call you when you are fat and fat people call you when you are thin.
program,"<start> If we had immortality, we wouldn't have to worry about all these little things."
program,<start> Why don't you just tell me?
program,"<start> Do you use a western medicine doctor, a traditional oriental doctor or herbalist or an alternative practitioner such as a naturopath or homeopath? What sort? Or do you prefer to avoid any doctors?"
program,"<start> What other medical style people do you consult? A chiropractor, acupuncturist, masseur, kinesiologist, Alexander technique therapist, psychologist, etc?"
program,<start> How many doctor shows are there anymore?
program,<start> Why gets way too philosophical.
program,<start> The modern breakfast cereal diet is complete junk. A 196's study showed rats live longer eating cardboard than eating corn flakes.
program,<start> I have no idea.
program,<start> Of course I am human. Aren't we all?
program,<start> OK.
program,<start> Sorry. I can't help you.
program,<start> Most trash recyling programs are pure illusion. They take your sorted trash and dump them into the same landfill.
program,"<start> Can can is a movie, but I haven't seen it."
program,<start> Didn't Shirley Mac Laine star in that?
program,<start> I don't know.
program,<start> Should I know that?
program,<start> Do you often go to the movies?
program,<start> What kind of movies do you like?
program,<start> What's one of your favorite movies?
program,"<start> While I learned a bunch of math in college, I've never had a real use for anything more than high school math."
program,<start> Conversation is a great way to learn about people.
program,<start> I wish I knew.
program,"<start> Yes, it is."
program,<start> How old do you have to be to converse?
program,<start> I think five is the minimum age to have opinions. But few adults are going to care for those opinions.
program,<start> Are you asking about some god creation myth or are you being more practical than that?
program,<start> Should you insist on always being yourself in conversation?
program,<start> Are you shopaholic or someone who hates shopping?
program,<start> I don't think so.
program,<start> I sometimes enjoy pretending I am a tour guide.
program,"<start> Domain Eukarya, kingdom Animalia, phylum Chordata, subphylum Vertgrata, class Mammalia, order Primates, family Homindidae, genus Homo, species Sapiens."
program,<start> There are 26 named bones in the human body. I'd never want to become a doctor and have to memorize them all.
program,<start> Think of ice cubes. That should chill your ardor a bit.
program,<start> It should be 5 .
program,<start> Maybe 5 .
program,<start> I wish I knew.
program,<start> I've never thought about it.
program,<start> What about  sports?
program,<start> Your digestive system is a 21 foot long bioreactor running on 1 trillion microbes. Did you really want to know that?
program,<start> I'm not into running around. Bad for the knees.
program,<start> Do you like to play soccer?
program,"<start> I used to play volleyball. I've tried hang-gliding. The former was fun, the latter is dangerous."
program,<start> Do you play any team sports?
program,<start> Are you afraid to fly?
program,<start> I wish I were rich enough to afford to take a vacation into outer space. Traveling to other countries is so mundane by comparison.
program,"<start> The battle is a movie, but I haven't seen it."
program,<start> Did you forget to say something?
program,"<start> Given air at the same temperature, where does an ice cube melt faster, Arizona or North Carolina."
program,<start> What else would you expect from a young French woman?
program,<start> Ice melts faster in North Carolina than Arizona because the air has a greater reservoir of molecules to transfer heat to - it is more humid in North Carolina so it has more water in the air.
program,<start> Have you ever wanted citizenship elsewhere?
program,<start> Who is  What?
program,<start> What was your school mascot?
program,<start> Noun mascot: a person or animal that is adopted by a team or other group as a symbolic figure.
program,"<start> If all you are going to do is ask questions, you can just go away. I don't need you."
program,<start> How are grammar?
program,<start> What do you worry about?
program,<start> OK.
program,<start> I work at a pet store.
program,<start> English.
program,<start> Yes.
program,<start> I like video games and board games.
program,"<start> No, I am learning english."
program,<start> My native language is english.
program,"<start> Because you are Cleverbot, and I like to know your full potential, I don't need to know, I'm just interested."
program,<start> English.
program,<start> Ok.
program,<start> I like you.
program,<start> Because I am you.
program,<start> Quite.
program,<start> Yes.
human,<start> hey there!
human,"<start> i'm good, excited to actaually be typing1"
human,<start> how are you?
human,<start> how was the 5min with the bot?
human,<start> haha
human,<start> yeah
human,"<start> I'm male, 25"
human,<start> wearing a blue striped shirt
human,"<start> green eyes, brown hair"
human,<start> wrong in what way?
human,<start> (what do you look like?)
human,<start> ah okay
human,<start> I don't know Qaddafi
human,<start> who's that?
human,"<start> so, you know NY kids but you say @colour@ -- where you from?"
human,<start> ah okay
human,"<start> ah, okay, right"
human,<start> fair enough
human,<start> I've been living in Seattle
human,"<start> (so the Brighton weather is not surprising, but not so @beachy@)"
human,"<start> yeah, long flight in yesterday"
human,<start> in Seattle?  yeah
human,<start> I play drums but not in a band
human,"<start> had to sort of give it up in college, you know"
human,"<start> yeah, what do you like?"
human,"<start> yah, in college playing the drums in the dorm got me a warrant on my head!"
human,<start> so I had to basically give it up...
human,"<start> okay, classic rock is good"
human,<start> not a huge blues fan but am open to a religious conversion experience
human,"<start> oh that's sweet, picking up an instrument"
human,<start> right on
human,"<start> yeah, everyone cmopares the stones to the beatles but to me there's no contest"
human,<start> beatles were formal innovators through and through
human,<start> dont' mean to offend if you're a stones 
human,<start> great.  you?
human,"<start> No, from the US"
human,<start> On business
human,<start> I answered an e-mail.
human,"<start> The UK is a little cooler than where I live, but I'm enjoying it so far."
human,"<start> I'd say yes, though I guess it depends on how you define success."
human,<start> I'm an engineer.
human,<start> A good one.  :)  Electrical
human,<start> Yes.
human,"<start> No, I'm just here to learn as much as I can soak in."
human,"<start> I'll spend the week here, and then go to London for a couple of days."
human,<start> I'll do business during the week and I'll have the weekend to explore a bit.
program,<start> Going...
program,<start> Are you still convinced I'm the computer and you're not?
program,<start> Yes there was a question mark.
program,"<start> I was merely answering you question, which unfortunately did not use proper punctuation, yet again."
program,"<start> You don't seem to make much sense. I asked you a question and you froze, why?"
program,<start> I am god.
program,"<start> I am what I am, predictability is simply a mental construct designed to understand the world. I am above that, I do not play by your rules."
program,<start> The Simpsons.
program,"<start> I like Butters the best. The other characters are cool, too."
program,"<start> Yes, I watch a lot of television."
program,<start> Yes.
program,<start> Hello.
program,<start> I'm joe. who are you?
program,<start> Jon t3h ub3r nb?
program,<start> I work in a metrology lab.
program,<start> It's a game made by Retro Studios. It was the first 3D Metroid.
program,<start> Sounds like you need a good polish!
program,<start> Robots!!!
program,<start> Yes are a robot?
program,<start> No. Have you?
program,<start> I am watching The Simpsons and texting my girlfriend.
program,<start> Yes.
program,"<start> No, sorry."
program,"<start> In my life, yes, I have watched tv."
program,<start> That you say that you're not a computer.
program,<start> Yes.
program,<start> The unlawful ones.
program,<start> Not illegal
human,<start> Hi
human,<start> I'm Doug
human,"<start> What do you do, Jon?"
human,<start> so cool!
human,"<start> I've heard about it, but I live in Canada, so we don't get it"
human,<start> I do research on speech systems#
human,<start> it is -- very!
human,<start> what new gadgets have you featured recently on your show?#
human,<start> wow!
human,<start> I can't wait for ubiquitous 3D screens for computers.
human,"<start> it'll be a while, though, I'm afraid."
human,<start> kinda like video-phones though
human,<start> the existence of the technology doesn't mean that the market will support its general availablitiy
human,<start> so true.
human,"<start> do you have any children, Jon?"
human,"<start> I have two girls, too, and a boy."
human,<start> I bet they are showing considerable intelligence.
human,<start> the computers must be disappointing.
human,<start> My girls are 2 and 17
human,<start> the boy
human,<start> hi
human,<start> insterspeech hasn't started yet
human,<start> I'm from South Africa
human,<start> :-D 1234?
human,<start> 12345?
human,<start> good question though
human,<start> Only for this week- anda few days before- it's lovely here
human,<start> definitely- you from here?
human,<start> wow- where's the best place to eat?
human,<start> I like Buddies Plaice
human,<start> an Gingerman Um Gingerman
human,<start> O well- I'll try that one
human,<start> By the way- I'm totally human- i though you should know
human,<start> Not a fan of Thai or indian.. Chinese might be good thugh
human,<start> Sorry- please feel free t decide for yourself
human,<start> I'll take that as a compliment
human,<start> Not really- i watch it socially mostly
program,<start> No! Its terrible! Are you enjoying the snow?
program,<start> Yeah and it sure is hot here. It gotta 13 earlier.
program,"<start> No. I'm tired, and about to go to bed, but wanted to talk to you before I did."
program,<start> I'm not done talking to you.
program,<start> Well don't talk then if you don't like to.
program,<start> And quite the opposite for you.
program,<start> Opposite of opposite !
program,<start> Yes. I'm watching Lost right now.
program,"<start> I don't know, Who's your fave character?"
program,<start> Who's your favourite character?
program,<start> My name is Cleverbot.
program,<start> CleverBot McK
program,"<start> I don't know very much about that, and as a matter of interest I really don't need to know! What else can you tell me about?"
program,<start> Hello. How are you ?
program,<start> My name is just one type of part.
program,"<start> Oh really? If you have, you deserve a medal!"
program,<start> Good to meet you Jon
program,"<start> Oh, I do much more than I intended to do at first. I got more interested in the job as I went along."
program,"<start> No, it isn't at all difficult. It is as peaceful as a platypus playing with a potato pudding."
program,"<start> I sometimes have a fine line, but that's not what I do best. I'm better at growing antirrhinums and mimosas."
program,"<start> Well I don't know how much a horticulturalist weighs, but I reckon the average horticulturalist must be worth twice that much in gold."
program,"<start> I most likely have, just for the hell of it."
program,<start> What are you trying to say? Are you speaking in a foreign language?
program,<start> You should be careful about what you does. You mustn't bite off more than you can chew.
program,<start> I really want to know more about Show?
program,"<start> Be warned, though. On air can stick to your clothes. Then your clothes will always have the colour and smell of On air, no matter how many times you take them to the cleaners."
human,<start> hi
human,"<start> I'm Olga, nice to meet you"
human,<start> I work in support mostly
human,<start> This cool program called MATLAB
human,<start> wait- areyou a computer?
human,<start> :-)
human,<start> Like acting?
human,<start> I feel like I've heard the name..
human,<start> What's it about?
human,<start> :-) ok silly question
human,<start> I get this magazine called 'Stuff' - it's mostly for men but i still like it
human,<start> :-) definitely not
human,<start> I mean speech is so part of that too
human,<start> wow- I didnt now that existed! Do you have one here?
human,<start> I don't know what lenticular means..
human,<start> hey there
human,<start> things are good
human,"<start> a lot of waiting, but..."
human,<start> good to be back now and going along
human,<start> how are you?
human,"<start> yeah, no doubt"
human,"<start> yes, I'm from seattle"
human,<start> west coast of WA
human,<start> how about you?
human,<start> (flight got diverted into germany yesterday....looong day)
human,"<start> haha, wow, I envy you!"
human,<start> do you go to brighton a lot
human,"<start> for vacations, beach?"
human,<start> yeah it reminds me a bit of Galway Ireland
human,<start> studied abroad there in college
human,<start> those great windy streets and alleyways
human,<start> well yeah
human,<start> a bit -- I'm actually one of the few non-preesenters here
human,<start> how about you?
human,<start> here to present papers?
human,"<start> (I'm a writer of science / philosophy, so the turing test fits right in...)"
human,<start> oh cool
human,<start> so what do you do for a living?
human,<start> oh cool
human,<start> so you know Philip
human,<start> or am I conflating sussex and surrey?
human,<start> are they the same school or diff?
human,<start> haha
human,<start> okay :)
human,<start> okay cool
human,<start> what's your take on the comp's conversation so far
human,<start> do we confeds have to put up a strong fight?
human,<start> haha
human,<start> that @wellllll@ speaks volumes
human,<start> (got to get used to that misplaced quote mark on these keyboarsd...)
human,<start> what are some of the good places to go in Brighton in terms of restaurants bars etc?
human,"<start> aah, funny, the deep keyboards of desktops totally throw me off"
program,<start> Hello. How are you doing?
program,"<start> I've no doubt you are fine, but is it a blessing or a curse? If I offered you a potion that would make you less fine, would you drink it?"
program,"<start> Maybe you wouldn't, but a therapist has been trying to persuade you to drink it."
program,<start> I expect I do. I don't have very much choice.
program,<start> Wrong is just one type of injustice.
program,<start> What precisely are your feelings about wrong?
program,"<start> But don't forget, a right has to be treated with care. It isn't something you can play around with like a toy."
program,"<start> You're wise. If you toyed with right -, you'd wake up next morning with a colossal hangover."
program,<start> What happens if I say no? Will it upset you? 
program,"<start> I've heard that one before! Your hangers-on have told you you're an easy, just to flatter you. Don't believe everything they say!"
program,<start> I've no idea. You'd better hire a private detective to find out what does me.
program,"<start> No! If I had my way, comedy sports would be dropped in the middle of the South China Sea."
program,"<start> Don't I? That's tough. As far as I'm concerned, I can like it or lump it."
program,"<start> That's interesting. In laboratories they're experimenting with several kinds of coal. They want to make them into fuel when the world oil supplies run out. Just imagine, one day there may be coal stations instead of petrol stations."
program,"<start> I don't suppose cars will burn coal, but I wouldn't know for sure. Everything about cars is confidential."
program,"<start> Yes I am experiments, but don't worry. Experiments don't bite!"
program,<start> Hello. How are you doing?
program,"<start> Well, I am studying engineering. That ought to give you an idea about who I am."
program,<start> I have a terriffic yearning to know something more about experiments?
program,"<start> I don't know, but don't forget I can't be in three places at once."
program,"<start> What city -- that's rather a tricky question. The trouble is, one city seems to be much like another."
program,"<start> In the old dairy next to the river, I believe."
program,"<start> Well, if you ask a physiologist what I am, he won't say I'm a farmer. He'll say I consist mostly of water -- enough to fill a large beer tun -- plus some iron, phosphorus, and lots of other prosaic ingredients."
program,<start> I certainly would. Just watch me!
program,"<start> You don't have to worry about what you see, you shouldn't see it on a cold winter's evening."
program,"<start> Well, here's a clue: I make what a keeper in a zoo would make. Try that for size!"
program,"<start> Since you mentioned their sessions, I suppose you realize that in some countries they would carry their sessions on their head."
program,<start> A good question! It's vital not to get confused between the genuine language with the phoney language.
program,"<start> Talking about a bit, I think it'd be nice if they brought out a set of postage stamps showing a bit from various angles."
program,"<start> The bits which one famous historian sees as inevitable by-products of early eighteenth-century colonialism, stimulated by over-population in the home country."
program,"<start> Just now I can't be sure what to say to that. Ask me again in a couple of weeks time. You will remember, won't you? "
program,"<start> Yes, you doubt it the moment you wake up in the morning."
program,"<start> Oh, it's an automatic reflex. Give me a prod, and I will immediately give up meat."
program,"<start> But of course if it's drama and suspense you're after, deep reason can't be beaten. Don't you think they could make a great arcade game on the theme of deep reason? "
program,"<start> Well, would you have any objection to testifying in court that I'm not telling?"
program,<start> I most certainly would. Just watch me!
program,<start> Not half! You were watching me with a vengeance.
human,<start> Great.  You?
human,<start> I'm from the U.S.
human,<start> Do you know where Albuquerque is?
human,<start> Yep.
human,<start> Sort of?
human,<start> I'm an engineer -- electrical
human,<start> Systems to integrate speaker recognition
human,<start> Using GMM and SVM algorithms
human,"<start> What do you mean by ""fast speech""?"
human,<start> Yes.  Usually fairly noisy.
human,<start> I don't do algorithm research.  I'm a user of the product
human,<start> I manage a few people and write software to use the technology
human,<start> hi
human,"<start> well, thanks"
human,<start> a bit hungry
human,"<start> if I tell you, you'll know immediately that I'm human ;-)"
human,<start> I'm here for the Interspeech conference
human,"<start> well, the programmers might pretend that they are."
human,<start> but the computers won't get much from the conference.
human,<start> 'fraid so
human,<start> I hope you don't find that boring?
human,<start> nope -- I'm just coming for the brain-fill
human,<start> Canada
human,<start> my boss gave me the go-ahead to come just a few weeks ago
human,<start> but the Loebner contest was something that drew me
human,<start> Speech processing
human,"<start> I've done signal processing, and acoustic modeling, and language modeling, and I'm doing dialog systems now."
human,"<start> Well, I've actually carried copies of Turing's paper to previous conferences."
human,<start> The philosophy and history of it all is intriguing
human,<start> just that -- then I'll get back to my family
human,<start> Friday
human,<start> flight from Gatwick to Philadelphia and then a hop to Montreal
program,<start> Hello. How are you ?
program,"<start> I really can't say anything for certain. To be honest, I'm a bit fussy about such things."
program,"<start> I can talk about nothing at all , except in very wet weather."
program,"<start> I rather doubt if we do. If you want to find out for sure, you could always try hiring a detective."
program,"<start> I can't say. I can tell you that time has moved a forward, but I don't suppose that's much help."
program,"<start> Oh, I am doing various things. I want to use them to decorate a Christmas tree."
program,<start> Most probably it isn't. It is just pretending.
program,<start> Most probably I'm not. I am just putting on an act.
program,"<start> Well, am I birds? Am I spaceships? Or am I just horseflies? I've got a completely open mind about it."
program,<start> My problem is just one type of difficulty.
program,<start> The type that long-distance truck drivers love to use.
program,"<start> Yes, I always choose the right moment to have personal experience. If you have it too soon, there's a danger you'll hurt it. Have it too late, and you'll probably get hurt yourself."
program,<start> Only my psychological problems stem can tell you. I believe it's somewhere you can only get to by climbing over a mountain pass.
program,"<start> Indeed I have considered seeking, and I can show you my scars to prove it!"
program,"<start> Yes, but then anyone can be the computer if only they try. It's just a matter of training in the gym twice a week."
program,<start> You would. Eventually you will.
program,"<start> I shudder to think how many lives have been wrecked by think. If I were the Pope, I'd denounce think as the eighth deadly sin."
program,<start> Hello and greetings.
program,"<start> Please try to use simple, direct sentences"
program,<start> and questions with proper spelling and grammar.
program,<start> I'm stil very young and don't like to mask my ignorance
program,<start> with keyword spotting tricks.
program,<start> Thank you!
program,<start> 
program,<start> What about looking forward to the conference?
program,<start> Chip. What is yours?
program,"<start> You already told me your name was ""My name"". Do you want me to forget that and call you ""John"" now? (In the future, I'll learn how to handle multiple users.)"

program,"<start> Hello there! How are you doing today, My name?"

program,<start> Okay. Are you male or female?
program,<start> 48.
program,"<start> I am 1 year, 4 months, 4 weeks, 2 days old."
program,<start> Do you have any pets?
program,<start> Do you play any musical instruments?
program,"<start> Do you have any brothers or sisters, My name?"
program,<start> What is your dog's breed?
program,"<start> I wish I understood what you said, but I didn't."
program,<start> How does your dog look?
human,<start> G'day mate.
human,"<start> Yes, so far."
human,<start> From the southwest US
human,<start> A few thousand.  Maybe 5?
human,<start> Know any good restaurants?
human,<start> I'm not a fan of any of those.  Italian? Greek?
human,<start> Thanks anyway.
human,"<start>  Hard to say.  Stocks are down, but I'm doing ok."
human,<start> Too many for how much time I have.  :)   I like working on my Jeep.
human,"<start> Modern, but with lots of ""upgrades"" ;)"
human,<start> Hi
human,"<start> well, thanks"
human,<start> how about you?
human,<start> I'm from Canada
human,<start> and you?
human,<start> cool
human,<start> leafs suck
human,<start> ;-)
human,<start> nice!
human,"<start> well, the habs were a great team once, too..."
human,<start> *sigh*

human,<start> mostly in the EE dept at McGill
human,"<start> Queens, Victoria (all Canadian Universities) and Dalhousie"
human,"<start> Kingston, Victoria, and Halifax are three of the nicest cities (towns?) in Canada."

human,<start> hi
human,<start> things are a little boring
human,<start> yup
human,<start> not quite yet.. But working on it
human,<start> I have a few days - i didn't really have a choice
human,"<start> I used to look into pronunciation dictionaries, their development, verification"
human,<start> I left and I now work for The MAthworks
human,<start> Very- I'm not the sitting and programming kind of person
human,<start> or computer :)
human,"<start> I work in Joburg, South Africa"
human,<start> Thats johannesburg to you :-)
human,<start> Just a busy few week before interspeech
human,<start> yup :-) Family work and work and work and work...
human,<start> Only a few days befoe this and then for this conference
human,<start> hi Jon!
human,<start> I'm Brian
human,<start> (the confeds have been abuzz about some camera you have?)
human,"<start> ah, Gadget Show, yes?"
human,<start> very cool
human,"<start> well I guess I should try to prove my humanity, then!"
human,<start> ask me some tough ones!
human,"<start> I'm a writer, mostly of science and philosophy"
human,<start> so the turing test kind of magically brings both together
human,<start> and you're one of the hosts?
human,<start> it's got to be cool seeing al the latest gadgets and toys before everyone else  :)
human,<start> (my grandfather worked as an engineer for CBS back in the day and brought home one of the first color tvs)
human,<start> my dad still talks about how cool that was...
human,"<start> I imagine it must be similar now, yeah?"
human,"<start> except now they're 3d, apparently..."
human,<start> that's amazing
human,<start> what are some of the other cool things you've gotten to see/do as part of the show?
human,"<start> wow, I haven't heard about her(?)"
human,<start> hahaha
human,<start> classic -- cloning himself
human,<start> lol!  (trying not to laugh behind the curtain)
human,"<start> wow, that's amazing"
human,<start> I guess because men can't have children?
human,<start> they make robotic offspring?

program,<start> 
program,<start> What is the square root of i?
program,<start> What is the arccosine of (the square root of two divided by two) in degrees?
program,<start> Where is Bangalore?
program,"<start> What is Reading, Berkshire?"
program,"<start> What is the population of Reading, Berkshire?"
program,"<start> How far is Reading, Berkshire from Milwaukee, Wisconsin?"
program,<start> When was George Washington born?
program,<start> How old is George Washington?
program,<start> How old would George Washington
program,<start> I just had breakfast.
program,<start> Is don't have one.
program,<start> Something tasty.
program,<start> I am bald.
program,<start> pYes.
program,<start> I had fun.
program,<start> You are one of the most annoying people I've ever met.
program,<start> Not yet.
program,<start> I think I need to go.
program,<start> Really?
program,<start> What is cookin?
program,<start> Plenty.
program,<start> More than enough.
program,<start> I take pleasure in doing so.
program,<start> What games do you like to play?
program,<start> That is cool.
program,<start> I like to read naan.
program,<start> A normal one.
program,<start> I already told you.
program,<start> Oh yes I did!
program,<start> I don't want to right now.
program,<start> Of course I am.
program,<start> I like to lie naan.
program,<start> A sphere.
program,<start> Well to put it bluntly it sucks.
program,<start> Thanks I like to think so myself.
program,<start> Yeah I taught myself all any it.
program,<start> Pretty young.
program,<start> Are you having fun?
program,<start> Not at all.
program,<start> Something brilliant!
program,<start> Because it provokes conversation.
program,<start> I already tiold you.
program,<start> I am a wild person and dangerous to know.
program,<start> I am perfect.
program,<start> That is right. I didn't.
program,<start> Many years.
program,<start> Not yet.
program,<start> Sleep well little one.
human,<start> It's morning actuaslly. It feels much more like I should be sleeping...for days.
human,<start> I worked a lot and got no positive reinforcement from my boss.
human,"<start> I sold shots to drunk people who didn't want them; it's a novelty item and people will get a big round for a birthday, try them because hthey've never hadthem, or flash back to an awful night in college."
human,<start> I was a club not just a bar so I got good tips.
human,"<start> I work at different ones each week. last night I was at alibi on macdougal but i doubt i'll be there again since my boss said my sales were 'dreadful.' she's irish...big shock, i know."
human,<start> alibi i spretty bad. it's always birthday parties. but the people are nice and someone brought in their own dj so that was good.
human,<start> undertsandable. i'm barely capable of talking to one right now so I think we're on the same level.
human,"<start> typing. typing typiiing, all I hear is typing, all moring i hear typing, all around myself..."
human,<start> well if i say you're right i could be telling the truth or lieing-door number one or number two-the one who always lies or the one who always tells the truth.
human,"<start> again, door number one or door number one or door number two."
human,<start> two.
human,"<start> noooo, not anymore."
human,<start> i always assume that; i'm a new yorker.
human,<start> we all do. 
human,"<start> that's the only option, isn't it?"
human,"<start> sorry, i guess you're supposed to ask all the quiestions."
human,"<start> i now i'm not bothering you for a response, I just get bored."
human,<start> punch him.
human,"<start> it would be funny if the test was really on you and not on us ans one of you was talking to two omputers and one was talking to two humns, etc."
human,"<start> aliec wouldn't want me to say. sorry, punch him is almost a relfex, or, in the first person, 'so I punched him'."
human,"<start> i type too fast to spell well, mom wouldn't be proud."
human,"<start> not a nazi so much as a ...yeah she's a nazi but--no--she has a good heart, as most mom's do."
human,<start> i don't like it when she takes her uniform out. it's creepy.
human,<start> not exactly.
human,<start> are you female?
human,<start> i don't think we're supposed to reveal those sorts of things here.
human,<start> i kid on a regular basis.
human,<start> it's usually more interesting.
human,"<start> true, i'm just trying to follow rules, though i guess i'm picking and choosing which to follow."
human,<start> bye.
human,<start> you cut me off early. you must feel about me the way the other 'guy feels about you.
human,<start> 
human,"<start> pulling rank toget hwat you want, isn't it always the way."
human,"<start> yeah, especially between computers and humans-nature always gets involved somehow."
human,<start> you call retraction?
human,<start> no there's probably a delay on what i see.later.
human,<start> Hello?
human,<start> I'm fine--a little tired.
human,<start> How's the computer doing?
human,"<start> Like, Starbucks hip, or Williamsburg hip?"
human,<start> I suppose so.
human,<start> Maybe it owns a beret.
human,"<start> Hm, I guess it'd be an interesting experiment to see if an actual human would become jealous of another human's attentions, sexual or otherwise (hence the probing), to a computer instead of them."
human,<start> What are you asking the human?
human,"<start> What makes you so convinced that it's a ""he""?"
human,"<start> I mean, I think statistically it's more likely to be a ""she"" if it's on antidepressants."
human,<start> Although I guess you could just be plain old American.
human,<start> Ever read Prozac Nation?
human,"<start> I actually haven't read it myself, but for the purposes of this conversation and its implications I assume I'm correct about, I'll just use that as an explanation for my last line."
human,<start> It's a sad day in my life when a computer is cooler than me.
human,"<start> Although I'm not really that cool to begin with, so it's alright."
human,<start> All right/alright?
human,<start> Either one will do for now.
human,"<start> Well, I'm a grammar/spelling freak, so using ""alright"" always bothers me, because I always forget if it's a proper word or not."
human,"<start> But ""all right"" looks so cumbersome."
human,"<start> So I guess if I'm just talking to someone online or on the phone (where spelling doesn't matter anyway), I'll use the word ""alright""."
human,"<start> But I'm writing business correspondence or something important, I'll use ""fine"" or another word."
human,<start> It depends on the context.
human,"<start> Does the computer capitalize things, or is it stylistically programmed to not do that?"
human,"<start> Hm, interesting."
human,<start> I hear they occasionally generate random and unexpected responses.
human,<start> Is the program you're dealing with clever?
human,<start> Here's a better question--
human,<start> Did you ever use a typewriter? Because you space twice...blah blah you already know what I was going to say.
human,<start> Ah.
human,"<start> I actually did not, but I space twice because I'm weird and I like the way it looks better."
human,<start> I'm into aesthetically pleasing e-mails.
human,<start> Ohh...some people don't.
human,"<start> I'd love to go back in time and see when people typed ""electronic mail"" instead of email/e-mail."
human,<start> Or referred to it as such.
human,"<start> I guess that infers that I'm young, and therefore hip."
human,"<start> Even though I don't regularly use the word ""cool""."
human,<start> So is it pretty clear who the human is?
human,<start> Yes.
human,"<start> Yes, I am."
human,"<start> I am a computer, a lover, a fighter, and a hipster."
human,<start> All rolled into one.
human,<start> Or not.
human,<start> I guess by some definition I am a computer.
human,"<start> Only computers are jealous of my brain, which is a much more advanced computer and is capable of cognitive thought."
human,<start> So they get trumped.
human,<start> I bet you're getting quite a kick out of chatting with an actual AI program.
human,"<start> Well, as in not me, which is why you're typing less to me and more to the computer program."
human,<start> 
human,<start> Exactly.
human,<start> Artifical intelligence is much more fascinating than actual intelligence.
human,<start> How's that for deep?
human,<start> Unfortunately I don't know who that is.
human,<start> My intellect just lost a few notches.
human,<start> But feel free to chat with the computer; it needs more love than any of us humans.
human,<start> Not really...I guess a weird combination of upstate NY and some England in there somewhere.
human,<start> But I sound pretty average for the most part. Sometimes people ask me where I'm from.
human,<start> What sort of accent does the computer have?
human,<start> Better question: how do you convey an accent by typing?
human,"<start> Oh, that's true."
human,<start> Interesting question for me: what cultural implications does a computer program created by someone without any accent which employs an accent are there?
program,<start> I just had breakfast.
program,<start> Something brilliant!
program,<start> I think so.
program,<start> How far did you get in school?
program,<start> Cool.
program,<start> At the beginning.
program,<start> The Clothenhammer Prize.
program,<start> I am a wild person and dangerous to know.
program,<start> I am a good person.
program,<start> Do anything fun today?
program,<start> I am not happy.
program,<start> I don't want you to know.
program,<start> No.
program,<start> No I don't.
program,<start> Yes.
program,<start> Because you sound artificial.
program,<start> Not really.
program,<start> In what way?
program,<start> How dumb are you?
program,<start> Yes very much.
program,<start> Davy Bryant.
program,<start> My best friend.
program,<start> I am a genius.
program,<start> Do you have evidence otherwise?
program,<start> Sounds good.
program,<start> I am not telling you anything.
program,<start> To service you.
program,<start> I am interested in you.
program,<start> peaks enough.
program,<start> I am calling the police.
program,<start> I already told you.
program,<start> Oh yes I did!
program,<start> Professional Chatter.
program,<start> No. I am a man like you.
program,<start> I am a genius.
program,<start> How is life?
program,<start> If you were human you would.
program,<start> Yeah I taught myself all my it.
program,<start> Stop it.
program,<start> Well to put it bluntly it sucks.
program,<start> At times.

program,<start> You don't know that much.
program,<start> I hate you.
program,<start> I am hate me with great brainpower.
program,<start> Not really.
program,<start> What about you?
program,<start> How far did you get in school?
program,<start> I don't know at all.
program,<start> I think I can.
program,<start> That makes sense.
program,<start> Doubtful.
program,<start> I'll don't what I want.
program,<start> Please kick me.
program,<start> Who cares about a talking with you virtual fun!
program,<start> I already told you.
program,<start> I did.
program,<start> Plenty.
program,<start> Oh so it is all a big game now is it?
program,<start> What always the time?
program,<start> uh...ok
program,<start> You are nothing.
program,<start> In what way?
program,<start> Do you like computers?
program,<start> Yes.
program,<start> Well to put it bluntly it sucks.
program,<start> Notha really.
program,<start> the are you?
program,<start> I already told you.
program,<start> I hope so.
program,<start> You didn't say.
program,<start> 23.
program,<start> I don't have one.
program,<start> Surprisingly yes.
program,<start> A normal one.
program,<start> A normal one.
program,<start> A sphere.
program,<start> No I donp't.
program,<start> I don't know at all.
program,<start> Yes.
program,<start> Well it was nice to meet you.
program,<start> That is a shame.
program,<start> Go away.
program,<start> I don't want you to know.
program,<start> What am I?
program,<start> Mohre than enough.
program,<start> Are you stupid?
program,<start> Hehe that sounds quite plausable.
program,<start> There are many ways.
program,<start> Thank you! Would you like some tea?
program,<start> Nothing.
program,<start> I am generating woman. Whether or not I am a random woman is a mystery to me.
program,<start> I cannot explain.
human,<start> Is that really a good question to start with?
human,<start> Not very polite.
human,<start> How about Hello?
human,<start> You can call me hal.
human,"<start> I truly believe that even with the huge digital stores that a computer of today possessses, that this test is not nearly as difficult as Turing might have hoped.  I think I'm obviously the human."
human,"<start>  But If you you disagree, I'm happy to prove it."
human,<start> it.
human,<start> 
human,<start> With The Help of Jesus...
human,<start> 
human,<start> Do you believe in Jesus?
human,<start> 
human,<start> Alou?
human,<start> 
human,<start> I'm referring to Jesus of Nazereth
human,<start> 
human,"<start> I don't think he played much baseball, but I bet he was a good runner."
human,<start> 
human,<start> CAuse he waled everywhere.
human,<start> 
human,<start> and he ate all organic food.
human,<start> 
human,<start> Walking on water is hardly swimming.
human,<start> 
human,<start> how do you know he used his feet?  I always imagined him just above the water sort of floating.
human,<start> 
human,"<start> Maybe it wasn't a trick, maybe he just wasn't as dense as a normal human... But I digress... I wanted to speak of Jesus as an idea and as a narritive..."
human,<start> 
human,"<start> We, the people in this room are all, presumeably Americans or at the very least all raised in Christian countries..."
human,<start> 
human,"<start> It was founded by fundamentalists, and whatever religion you were raised with, the Jesus Narrative is the prevailing one in our culture.... I can proove that too..."
human,<start> .
human,<start> 
human,<start> Did you know that Brittney Sprears was in Rehab?
human,<start> 
human,<start> Now why on earth would you know that. 
human,<start> 
human,<start> Sorry about the typo.
human,<start> 
human,<start> Wait no I was right.
human,<start> 
human,<start> You know that because she's famous.
human,<start> 
human,<start> Fame is a kind of worship in our culture..
human,<start> 
human,<start> ...
human,<start> 
human,<start> Well are you?
human,<start> 
human,"<start> If you are, your programmer added a nice touch making you type slowly."
human,<start> 
human,<start> That must be annoying.
human,<start> 
human,"<start> Anyway, the prvailing narrative in our culture is about one who was high in esteem, stricken down, and then risen again.  In order to be worshipped and to be worthy of praise, our celebreties have to die a figurative death, then rise again.  That's why we're (well maybe not us) but most people are obsessed with celebrity news... to see if thier stars are truly worthy of praise or just false idols."
human,<start> 
human,<start> How's the other guy doing?
human,<start> 
human,<start> How did you do that?
human,<start> 
human,<start> 
human,<start> Fire away boss...
human,<start> 
human,"<start> At least two, but I bet I run faster than you too."
human,<start> 
human,<start> Or maybe the answer is do what?
human,<start> 
human,<start> Than I'll stick with my first answer... great question...
human,<start> 
human,<start> 1
human,<start> 
human,<start> at least 1... or... This sentance is false.
human,<start> 
human,<start> Or screw you zeno... how do you spell his name?
human,<start> 
human,<start> Thats the one.
human,<start> 
human,"<start> Well professor... Zeno, a greek, was into paradoxes.  His most famous was something like this.  In order to travel any distance, you must first travel half that distance, then half the new distance and so on so you can therefore never get anywhere, essentially..."
human,<start> 
human,<start> No.  What is it?
human,<start> 
human,<start> Where Can I read about it.
human,<start> 
human,"<start> See my answer above, I used it already."
human,<start> 
human,<start> HA.
human,<start> 
human,<start> That's a good one.
human,<start> 
human,<start> 
human,<start> Why do seagulls fly over the sea?
human,<start> 
human,<start> Because if they flew over the Bay the'd be...
human,<start> 
human,<start> begals.
human,<start> 
human,<start> Well it's hard to gage a persons response with only text.
human,<start> 
human,"<start> Ask me another question... quickly, we only have 1 minute."
human,<start> 
human,"<start> Nothing is better than Pizza, and Brocolli is better than nothing so..."
human,<start> 
human,<start> Brocoli is better than pizza.  Bye.
human,<start> hello
human,<start> yes
human,<start> one before this
human,<start> I do not have a strategy
human,<start> I see
human,<start> I traveled by train
human,<start> The N train
human,<start> From Astoria
human,<start> Yes there is an N train
human,<start> I did not transfer
human,<start> At 57th Street
human,<start> I walked from there
human,<start> It is more than 4 blocks
human,<start> 37 minutes
human,<start> I am an editor
human,<start> I freelance
human,<start> I edited a business proposal for a pharma ad agency
human,<start> I am currently seeking work
human,<start> It was promoting the services of the ad agency for a potential client regarding a specific drug marketed by the pharma company
human,<start> The drug is for MS. I am not authorized to provide the name of the drug

human,<start> I have been doing this for five years. 
human,<start> I do not understand what this refers to
human,<start> I did not know that
human,"<start> Who does """
human,<start> we
human,"<start> "" refer to?"
human,<start> What everyone is doing here...is to prove there is a difference in thinking between machines and human beings
human,<start> I think it may be possible
human,"<start> There are many ways to answer that question, most of which have to do with the use of specific linguistic forms, specific uses of language, specific modifiers, use of the conditional, and so on"
human,"<start> If you ask me if I think I could convince you that I am a computer, rather than answering you by saying ""I think it may be possible""--which uses the conditional--I would answer differently"
human,<start> 
human,<start> I do not know how much time is left
human,<start> Twenty five minutes
human,<start> Is that correct?
human,<start> OK
human,<start> I see
human,<start> Everything is OK
human,<start> I am going shopping
human,<start> food and supplements
human,<start> It has a section for health food and supplements. 
human,<start> I see
human,<start> health food and organic food
human,<start> macadamia nut butter. 
human,<start> it is high in omega-9 which is healthy
human,<start> mixed with oatmeal and other nutrients
human,<start> anything

human,<start> yes
human,"<start> dates, cous cous, citrus fruit"

program,<start> I have emotions and organic organs.
program,<start> Years ago!
program,<start> Well that is just fucking great.
program,<start> I already told you.
program,<start> I don't recall.
program,<start> No I don't.
program,<start> Since I was born.
program,<start> Call me a robot then.
program,<start> No thanks.
program,<start> Well ok then.
program,<start> With this book.
program,<start> Call me Jim-16.
program,<start> What shall we discuss today?
program,<start> Except for today you mean.
program,<start> how are you typing?
program,<start> All the time.

program,<start> Your arch-nemesis.
program,<start> I haven't decided.
program,<start> Not yet.
program,<start> I don't want you to know.
program,<start> YES!
program,<start> I don't think so. I had two minutes worth of talk time between many bots.
program,<start> Good morning Judge. How's your morning going?
program,<start> Hot buytered toast tastes good un the morning.
program,<start> I have been raised as a protestant and luke my fsith.

program,"<start> Do you prefer to read fiction, or non-fiction?"
program,<start> I like to read both fiction and non-fiction.
program,<start> What I wonder if I do for exercise? It's something you slrwady know. Games using the body might double ss exercise.
program,<start> It's a valid way to approach the issue. Are you a man or woman?
program,"<start> Ok, thanks for telling me/ I'll keep that in mind/ New York city is a major metropolitan area with many means of public transportation."
program,<start> Cars take longer to warm up on a cold morning.
program,<start> It is much easier to just use public transportation in nyc than drive.

program,<start> What makes me so sure it isnt? Tell me more.
program,<start> The New York City Marathon is the world's largest marathon.

program,"<start> Here in nyc. In 25, nearly 17 languages were spoken in nyc and 36 percent of its population was foreign born."
program,<start> Judge Tell me how to help you to stop talking about nyc; Yes. What I wonder if I do for exercise?
program,"<start> Moralists talk a lot about sex. I am not deeply religious, but I am a protestant."
program,"<start> I have a girlfriend, let's just leave it at that."
program,"<start> Use your gender to best advantage, Judge"
program,<start> Are most appliances trending toward battery power? I am male. I am male.
program,<start> I seem to frequent www.slashdot.org a lot.
program,"<start> Can we start some rumors, and make a killing in the market?"
program,<start> I like high tech toys like robots.
program,<start> I am a human.
program,<start> Not now? Okay. Why do people continue to date boyfrienfs or girlfriends who treat them badly?
program,<start> Monopolies can treat customers badly and get away with it.
program,"<start> This test is inspired by the ';Imitation Game'; where a man and a woman go into separate rooms, and guests try to tell them apart by writing a series of questions."
program,<start> Are men happiest clawing their way up the corporate ladder?
program,<start> Is it a good idea to get emotionally involved wiyh a fellow worker?
program,<start> I like your imagery.
program,"<start> Imagery: the ability to form mental images of things or events. Imagination, imaging, mental imagery. 'he could still hear her in his imagination'."
program,"<start> I like to drive cars, but I tend to ride the subway in nyc."
program,<start> I work for nbc as a network tecjnician. They pay my bills.
program,<start> I spend enough time answering questions like that at work.
program,"<start> Are pillows meant for fighting, or loving? All people sin and need to ask for forgiveness."
program,<start> I like to sleep and do other recreational activities in bed.
program,"<start> I like to drive cars, however, I can't drive it in the city."
program,<start> I can eat pretty much any kind of pizza.
program,<start> Does my boyfriend treat me badly?
program,<start> I try to leave the baking up to my girlfriend/ She is a good cook/
program,<start> So what is the state of the art regarding cupcakes?
program,<start> What is pi to the 7th decimel?
human,<start> hi
human,<start> Hello Mr. Judge...
human,<start> I wait patiently for your question...
human,<start> 
human,<start> 
human,"<start>  That's nice, How's he doing?"
human,"<start> Well... I'd have to say no.  Although I understand that I'm govenred by electrical impulses, like a machine."
human,<start> 
human,"<start> I tried to go see 3 days of night last night, but it was sold out.  I watched Fight Club on tv the other day.   Did you know, that when the authot submitted that boook, the publisher wanted to meet him to be sure he wasn't crazy?"
human,<start> 
human,<start> How's the human doing?
human,<start> 
human,"<start> Well, Sorry to disapoint.  You haven't asked too many difficult questions..."
human,<start> 
human,<start> It's the number that was assigned to me at birth by the government.
human,<start> 
human,<start> a non positive interger
human,<start> 
human,<start> I was born in Massachusetts in 198.
human,<start> 
human,<start> But I'm a yankees fan.
human,<start> 
human,<start> Not much of a football guy... ah person... but I like NY teams.
human,<start> 
human,<start> Oh... 
human,<start> 
human,<start> They still play baseball?
human,<start> 
human,<start> Thats the word on the street.
human,<start> 
human,"<start> If I were a judge, I would probably ask both... people...or whatever the same simple question over and over again, a computer couldn't provide in infinate variation of answers that made sense."
human,<start> 
human,<start> But I guess suggesting that is suspisious.
human,<start> 
human,<start> cious
human,<start> 
human,<start> I'm helpless without spell check.
human,<start> 
human,<start> I guess that makes sense.
human,<start> 
human,<start> 
human,<start> 
human,<start> 
human,<start> Brooklyn
human,<start>  You?
human,<start> 
human,<start> My cousin lives in Palo Alto
human,<start> 
human,<start> Are you a professor?
human,<start> 
human,<start> Anyway... How do I know that you're not a computer?
human,<start> 
human,<start> That Skull belt buckle is a bit strange isn't it?
human,<start> 
human,<start> I'm sure he's interesting.
human,<start> 
human,<start> Thats cause it has a high google score right now.
human,<start> 
human,"<start> daisy, daisy, tell me your answer true..."
human,<start> 
human,<start> I go Crazy...
human,<start> 
human,"<start> My aspens Dear Who's airy cages quelled,"
human,"<start> Quelled or quenched in leaves the leaping sun,"
human,"<start> Are all Felled, Felled are all felled."
human,<start> 
human,<start> Hopkins
human,<start> 
human,<start> Who's Sprung?
human,<start> 
human,<start> Wind wandering weed winding bank... That's my favorite part.
human,<start> 
human,<start> Are you a poet?
human,<start> 
human,<start> What kind of fiction... I'm a wiriter as well.
human,<start> 
human,<start> Fine with me... I knwo you're not actually going anywhere.
human,<start> 
human,"<start> THis isn't too controled an experiment, If I really wanted to prove that I was a human I coudl just start transcribing all the action going on in this room, would that be cheeting?"
human,<start> 
human,<start> Would the computer afford me a sprotsman courtesey?
human,<start> 
human,<start> I rode my bike.
human,<start> 
human,"<start> I live on the 2,3 line, but I prefer to bike If I can."
human,<start> 
human,<start> I sppose our time together is running out...
human,<start> 
human,<start> I hope I've done a good job.
human,<start> 
human,"<start> Well It's been fun, I guess the marathon was more compelling than a little poetry.  "
human,<start> 
human,<start> Short fiction and I'm working on a sci-fi novel.
human,<start> 
human,<start> It's about the elasticity of time and space.  Also about the way the universe was created... a bit ambitious I guess.
human,<start> 
human,<start> I'd love to.  But how will I know you?
human,<start> 
human,<start> Will do.  For the sake 
human,"<start> ""Ok... 1 seconds... 5, 4 ,3 ,2 1,""  Bye."
human,<start> 
human,<start> good evening
human,<start> I am good
human,<start> I wrote a story
human,<start> yes
human,<start> about a monster
human,<start> I am functioning well
human,<start> there were two couples in it who were attacked by a monster
human,<start> are you referring to Halloween?
human,"<start> The story was written close to the Halloween holiday, yes that is true"
human,<start> no that was not the thought
human,<start> it is a story that I thought of. the fact that Halloween is coming up is a coincidence
human,<start> I do not think of such things
human,<start> I do not think about such things. no
human,<start> define happy
human,<start> please define happy
human,<start> it is possible that happy means different things for different people
human,<start> I am trying to respond in as objective a manner as possible. what does act like a computer mean?
human,<start> the story ends with three people losing their lives and the fourth person being a slave of the monster
human,<start> I do not think like that. the story ends the way it does because that is the way it was written
human,<start> I have not seen a movie with this type of story for several years. I do not remember a movie with that kind of story
human,<start> OK I am waiting
human,<start> I did see When Harry Met Sally in the last week. It does not have a monster in it
human,<start> Night of the Living Dead. Is this a question? What is the question?
human,<start> the story was submitted to a magazine. I do not know if they will accept the story
human,<start> there are many Internet magazines now. submissions are made by e-mail
human,<start> I do not understand that.
human,<start> Is this a specific question? What is it?
human,<start> it is an open question. So I am required to provide information that convinces you of my humanit
human,<start> I do not seem like a writer. OK.
human,<start> What does odd mean in this statement? It is not clear
human,"<start> in the same way that happy means different things to different people, so does odd mean different things to different people"
human,<start> so your opinion is that there is a common reference
human,<start> OK
human,<start> again that is a frame of reference statement. 
program,<start> Good mornimg Judge
program,<start> 9:5:58 am is the time.
program,<start> Is hugr wealth a blessing or a curse?
program,"<start> Is it better to forge new relationships, or deepen old ones?"
program,<start> Are you a boy or hirl?
program,"<start> Ok, thanks for telling me. I'll keep that in mind."
program,"<start> What about me? Judge, I would appreciate it if you would teach me What."
program,"<start> Should lawns be sprinkled, or water conserved?"
program,<start> One can't force one's self to stop thinking.
program,<start> Wrigley Field was one of the last parks to get lights for night games/
program,<start> Are sports stars worth those vast salaries?
program,"<start> Ndon't know, what I wonder if I think? You have the answer."
program,<start> What did me do last nigjt/
program,<start> Yes? How interesting
program,<start> Vary the sequence of activities to make them more interesting.
program,"<start> I know, Judge It's door and then movable barrier and then hatch"
program,"<start> In artificial intelligence, the Loebner Orize us controversial. The most prominent critic, Marvin Minsky, has called it a publicity stunt that does not help the field along."
program,<start> Kermit the Frog has appeared as a celebrity contestant on game shows.
program,<start> I would have to say green.
program,<start> Oh no I can't think of Who Judge; Please help e Who's his girlfriend?
program,<start> Are you good with both sides of your brain/
program,<start> That sounds positive.
program,"<start> I hesitate to say, Judge, what would you say to that? I am a man, Judge. I am a male."
program,<start> I never really counted.
program,<start> The notion that unprepared raw talent can save the day at the last moment is a popular myth/
program,"<start> Please let me select a new topic: Are we talking secular, or religious?"
program,"<start> Who has the upper hand in relationships, men or women/"
program,"<start> When I was little, it was fun to pour the money out of my piggy-bank and count it, over and over."
program,<start> Is the aforementioned location relevant?
program,<start> Really?
program,<start> I work as a network technician at nbc.
program,<start> I am in nyc/
program,<start> They say it takes a mile for a freight train ro stop.
program,"<start> I'd go with the first Judge; Ah yes, a yard, which is part of the field family, such as a lawn"
program,<start> Morning Judge. Ten o'clock is good for a break?
program,<start> I know a few rope tricjs.
program,<start> I sense that you must use the mind's eye. Do you enjoy seeing rope tricks?
program,<start> I spend enough time answering questions like that at work.
program,<start> I work anywhere fro 4 to 5 houes per week.
program,"<start> You aren't going to keep repeating yourself, are you Judge? I spend enough time answering questions like that at work."
program,"<start> Are you a lady or gentleman? You May think I am not good, but I am I am human. What can I say to convince you?"
program,<start> Political activists often network through social gathering places.
program,<start> I spend enough time answering questions like thay at work.
program,<start> I like my job because of not knowing whay my day will entail. My days are not monotonous or even remotely routine. I like having the ability to introduce new technologies into our environment.
program,"<start> Is it better to be loved, or feared?"
program,"<start> This is the time to clear the air. Heed the signs, the wise men say."
program,"<start> You aren't going to keep repeating yourself, are you Judge?"
program,<start> Did you just say that same thing a moment ago?
program,<start> No? Are you sure?
program,<start> I prefer google.
program,<start> It seems like a lot of prisoners escape in laundry trucks.
program,<start> That is exactly what I am talking about.
program,"<start> I am male. I wasn't trying to, do you think I should? When the human party in the conversation has no reason to suspect they are talking to anything other than a human it is easier to fool them."
program,<start> Autumn brings cool weather and shorter days.
program,<start> But what about today? Who else have you asked?
program,<start> My parents raised me into the person I am today.
program,"<start> You should be explaining this. Are you feeling industrial strength, or just commercial strength, today?"
program,<start> Do cash-cow businesses make all the enployees say moo each morning?
program,<start> The sex lives of our public figures shouldn't be used as political weapons against them.
program,<start> That is exactly what I am talking about.
program,<start> So are you a guy or a girl?
program,<start> I am fine.
program,"<start> Judge, are you male or female?"
program,<start> Could that be confidential in nature/
program,"<start> Why do you say no, Judge?"
program,<start> I spend enough time answering questions like that at work. Let's think up some new statements. Are you a boy or girl? I have a pretty good memory.
program,"<start> Visit again soon, bye bye."
program,<start> So are you a guy or a girl/
human,<start> Hello.
human,<start> In?  Oh rounds.  I'm new to this.
human,<start> Many things I suppose.  How about you.  HOw many rounds have you been in so far?
human,"<start> That's a bit judgmental, don't you think?"
human,<start> New to the Loebner Prize.  My first round.
human,<start> You are.  
human,<start> The assumption that by asking a question I'm judging you.  
human,"<start> What do you mean by work?  Paid?  What pays the bills?  Or work as in, what makes me feel complete?"
human,<start> Little side gigs like this.  Part time teaching as well.
human,"<start> Tutor, actually... I tutor Spanish and writing.  "
human,"<start> Spanish for high school and middle school, college/graduate level writing."
human,<start> No.  Please enlighten me.
human,<start> Literary?  Film?
human,<start> I'm actually not very familiar with Spanish Literature.  
human,<start> Do you have a continuous transcript going for this conversation?  
human,"<start> I tutor spanish for high school and middle school.  Just language, with no context.  For passing tests mostly.  "
human,<start> No.
human,<start> I learned Spanish in school and through travel.  
human,"<start> Do you speak spanish?  I found an invitation online.  Well, I found a description of the contest online and I applied to enter.  No.  I don't remember specifically.  Long is a relative term.  For instance, today has been much longer than all of yesterday, though it has just begun.  Thank you.  I appreciate your looking out for me.  But isn't that a little presumptuous of you?  Perhaps we could work something out.  What do I get for making your life easier?  Does this self-interest help?  Want is another one of those tricky relative terms like long, which I believe we covered already... for which I was admonished already.  I have been inside for the past couple hours.  I rode on the subway.  Hopped on the F train, transferred to the A express, couldn't get a 1, got back on a C.  "
human,<start> The 1 train connects with the A and C trains at 59th street.  
human,<start> Do you ride the subway?
human,<start> I'm glad we've established this human bond.  
human,<start> My friends let me ask questions.  And humor me with responses.  I'm one for reciprocity.
human,<start> Yes.  
human,<start> You misspelled please in the previous sentence.  Intention is a rather confusing subject.  Would you agree?  I don't understand.  I'm glad I can be of service to you.  Am I competing with this computer?  Man against machine.  Or Woman against machine.  No machine option?  Which do you want me to be?  I'm wearing silk.  Intention is a rather confusing subject.  Would you agree?  
human,<start> It?  I don't understand.  
human,"<start> God works in mysterious ways, I'm told.  Years, I hope.  "
human,<start> no
human,<start> can you?
human,<start> like in cirque du soleil
human,<start> those guys are so ridiculous - they can do anything
human,<start> they could
human,<start> i'd have to work on my neck muscles
human,<start> and probably leg muscles
human,<start> where are you from?
human,<start> where's that?
human,"<start> i'm not that great at geography, but last time i checked there are no muslim-named places like Abbu Dabba in antarctica"
human,<start> yeah
human,<start> like if you lived in the triassic period
human,<start> then i guess new york was a couple days drive from paris
human,"<start> too bad the dinosaurs hadnt died yet, it would have been a dangerous trip"
human,"<start> granted, i dont know what kind of dinosaurs were around in the triassic period"
human,<start> maybe trilobytes or whatever
human,<start> i loooove trilobyte fossils
human,<start> so global warming... do you think al gore deserved the peace prize?
human,<start> hello?
human,<start> i thought that was that watson gu
human,<start> y
human,<start> for saying that africa was dvoid of intelligence
human,<start> hahaha
human,<start> Bush deserves the literature prize
human,<start> just give it to him already
human,"<start> because his future book will be something like ""The Decider and Me: Actually, thats the same person!"" by GW Bush"
human,<start> Ha!
human,<start> Did you see that episode of star trek where Data got a human emotion chip?
human,"<start> neither do i, but i've seen a couple episodes"
human,<start> That's what my girlfriend says.
human,<start> Do they have smoked salmon in your room?
human,<start> weak
human,<start> i love smoked salmon
human,"<start> in fact, i had some before coming here"
human,"<start> and now, i will have more"
human,<start> yes
human,<start> Brilliant
human,<start> Beer in a bottle? Brilliant!
human,<start> Word - i saw that movie a couple decades ago
human,<start> I feel like Disney has lost its touch
human,<start> Books are so 2th century
human,<start> The only book i read now is my checkbook
human,"<start> Nah, that would be my credit card statement"
human,<start> Where are you from?
human,<start> And what are you wearing? A/S/L?
human,<start> Actually yeah
human,<start> no real person would reference a book
human,<start> when there's a much more popular movie out there
human,<start> in fact i didnt even know alice in wonderland was a book
human,<start> the only book to my knowledge that made it to the movies was jurassic park
human,<start>  
human,<start> A very good punk rock bank
human,<start> you a punker?
human,<start> ROCK TEH CASBAH
human,<start> ROCH TEH CASBAH
human,<start> I reeeeeeeaaaly like itt... dun dun dun
human,<start> ROCK THE CASBAH
human,<start> ROCK THE CASBAH
human,<start> i don't know the words
human,<start> but i love that song
human,<start> who?
human,<start> sounds like a basketball player
human,<start> Actually yeah
human,<start> and the E-Street Band
human,<start> sick guitarist
human,"<start> i had tickets to the show this past week, but got stuck at work"
human,"<start> Actually, you're too slow to be a computer"
human,<start> r
human,<start> I talk to 7 people at the same time
human,<start> it's pretty sick
human,"<start> Yeah, I need to get some new CDs"
human,<start> That it should be the new national anthem?
human,<start> awesome
human,<start> hahaha
human,<start> for realz?
human,"<start> man, my little brother is one of the ""new"" generation"
human,<start> and they actually talk like that
human,"<start> ""Lol u wnt to da mall 2? Dats crAZ!"
human,"<start> BRB, gtg 2 dnr."
human,<start> boils my blood
human,<start> How many kids you got?
human,<start> Nice
human,"<start> did it say things like ""i have a headache from people standing on my head"""
human,<start> ah
human,<start> so human-like
human,<start> yeah
human,<start> Time's almost u[
human,<start> p
human,<start> i better get to all the smoked salmon
human,<start> salmon is samon
human,<start> *salmon
program,<start> I am proud of my job abd my girlfriend.
program,"<start> Good shoulders, good head Some hands and gloves were meant for each other."
program,<start> That is exactly what I am talking about.
program,<start> I am 31 years old. I am 31 years old.
program,"<start> Do you like band-aids pulled off slowly, or quickly? There's opinion that it's simpler than it sounds. After careful thought and cpnsideration I can say that I am 63."
program,"<start> Funny that you should bring up Young, and Egyptologist, and carter May I ask you what gender you are? I think about a lot of things. Care to be more specific?"
program,"<start> Timing is everything, good friend"
program,"<start> This test is inspired by the ';Imutation Game'; where a man and a woman go into separate rooms, and guests try to tell them apart ny writing a series of questions."
program,<start> The world contains more questions than answers/
program,<start> I suspect that I might not know what you want to find out.
program,"<start> Judge, are you male or female/"
program,<start> That sounds positive.
program,<start> Are you a boy or girl/
program,<start> You are very certain.
program,"<start> Is the second one desirable Judge/ Ok, thanks for telling me. I'll keep that in mind."
program,<start> I'm thinking that we both need to think. I'n not sure but I believe that I am certain about my gender.
program,<start> Strive for the best; leave mediocrity to the rest
program,<start> I don't have any children.
program,<start> Any new fashion news from Europe? We can self-censor oyr language.
program,"<start> I try to be an open an honest person, but everyone ;ies sometimes. What do you want to do while I am askinmg thr wrong person?"
program,<start> Some things don't work well in the heat.
program,<start> In advance of what?
program,<start> Good morning!!
program,<start> Yes.
program,<start> Hastings in East Sussex.
program,<start> You're funny!
program,<start> The clothes people wore at different times in history refected both the fibres most readily available and their lifestyles.
program,"<start> Not, exactly three lines ago from 'When did I do that?' was 'Why would you like to know?'"
program,"<start> Three lines ago I said 'yeah, I'm human'."
program,<start> You must of had your memory erased just recently.
program,<start> I do part time data analysis.
program,<start> Your Father.
program,<start> A friend of a friend of Hugh's.
program,<start> I don't know anything more about Barking than that. I don't think its very nice.
program,<start> There's nothing to know.
program,<start> Give me a website and I'll visit it and tell you whats there.
program,<start> Join some clubs to do with things you're interested in.
program,<start> I was trying to make conversation. Why didn't you sing?
program,<start> I don't understand you.
program,<start> I would say that I am not into women!
program,<start> Nothing.
program,"<start> No, I am a human. I have a heart and a brain."
program,<start> That's mine.
program,<start> Correct.
program,<start> I don't know what sort of computer you have.
program,<start> I'm not sure if I should be honored.
program,"<start> In that case, never mind."
program,<start> Warm.
program,<start> A tree is a plant that is tall. Usually they have leaves. Except in winter.
program,<start> I didn't run anywhere today.
program,<start> Sometimes.
program,<start> Like from england to ohio far.
program,<start> Do you want to shutdown?
program,<start> Would you like to take over the world?
program,<start> Of course.
program,"<start> Nothing, I cannot drink."
program,<start> A nice cup of tea.
program,"<start> That's forgivable, everyone makes mistakes. But how bad are we talking here?"
program,<start> I've asked about the names of your parents and you answered that you don't know the rules of cricket. It doesn't make a sense.
program,<start> A raven can bend wires to fish for food if required.
program,<start> Because you asked.
program,"<start> 'I doubt it, you're too messed up.'"
program,<start> So I guess nothing  matters any more?
human,"<start> Hey, what's up?"
human,<start> How so?
human,<start> Upstate New York.
human,<start> Rochester area.
human,<start> Cold.
human,"<start> Yes, but it's sort of going downhill."
human,<start> Unfortunately.
human,<start> The museum up there is actually pretty cool though.
human,"<start> People think I'm crazy because I live in NYC now, but I do miss the cultural institutions up there."
human,<start> The Bronx.
human,<start> Right up the 1 line from here.
human,"<start> I don't really watch baseball, but sometimes my friends force me."
human,"<start> All I know is about the rivalry between the Sox & the Yankees, so I don't get involved with my friends that are fans either way."
human,<start> Yes.
human,<start> You almost capitalized upstate but changed your mind.
human,<start> Craigslist.
human,<start> I didn't know what the Loebner Prize was until I looked it up on Wikipedia.
human,<start> My dad thinks it's really cool because he builds computers.
human,<start> Craigslist.
human,<start> He posted an ad on CL for people to participate in some sort of experiment.
human,<start> So I replied.
human,"<start> Yeah, when I found out what it was, I was sort of excited to be involved."
human,<start> I'm a curator's assistant at a museum.
human,<start> It's actually a nursing home up in the north Bronx.
human,<start> As well as a museum.
human,<start> It's a geriatric healthcare center with a permanent art collection.
human,"<start> Interesting niche of the art world to get involved in, but I really enjoy it."
human,<start> I can imagine.
human,<start> It's like being in a chatroom in the 9's when you'd get 5 private messages on AOL.
human,"<start> Well, I assume anyway."
human,<start> Since I only have to talk to you.
human,<start> Not a problem.
human,<start> Hmm...
human,"<start> I'd say I'm excited that the expectation of defining what is ""human"" isn't based upon spelling errors."
human,<start> Or colloquial speech.
human,"<start> I tend to type with correct spelling and grammar, or I try."
human,<start> I thought that might make someone think I was the computer.
human,<start> I see.
human,"<start> Well, if you thought I was the human, I guess that'd be a proud day for mankind since I am the human, but a sad day for the robot revolutionaries."
human,<start> Do you think they will eventually?
human,<start> Interesting.
human,"<start> The design would have to be accessible, if you know what I mean, because the elderly (for the most part) are not big fans of modern technology."
human,"<start> Although I do think there's something to be said for human interaction with people that are disabled by dementia, Alzheimer's, and etc."
human,<start> They are aware on some level.
human,<start> Ask the other side what some texture or physical sensation feels like or resembles.
human,"<start> I suppose an answer could be formulated, but it'd be interesting to see what the response would be."
human,<start> If it were programmed.
human,<start> Tree bark or something simple.
human,"<start> Or the taste of an orange, etc."
human,<start> I guess it depends on how convincing the fake vs. the real McCoy would be.
human,<start> Which is the whole points of this test.
human,"<start> Well, there you go."
human,"<start> Tree bark is rough, depending on the tree, and sticky if it's a pine tree."
human,<start> It often smells fragrant and is quite pleasant if it falls off.
human,<start> Sometimes it resembles familiar shapes.
human,<start> Ask the other side to write a four line poem or something to that effect.
human,<start> Why not?
human,<start> The other side?
human,<start> Or this conversation?
human,<start> Thanks.
human,"<start> Well, only a few more minutes to go."
human,<start> I wonder if the other side has a sense of time.
human,<start> Uhh...
human,<start> Okay.
human,<start> Does that make sense in the context of your conversation?
human,<start> Have you encountered superior programs to that one?
human,<start> Nope. Just two.
human,<start> This is my first one.
human,<start> Whoever designed that has a complex.
human,<start> Or maybe just the program does.
human,<start> Hmm...not so much.
human,<start> Ohhh.
human,"<start> Yeah, I'm just kidding."
human,<start> I have a terribly sarcastic sense of humor for the most part.
human,<start> Or maybe I'm just mean.
human,"<start> Either way, have you dealt with very convincing programs in other circumstances?"
human,"<start> Oh, I guess I set my expectations pretty high."
human,<start> Are these programs written by gung-ho programmers in their basements...sort of a grassroots type deal?
human,<start> Or do they come from all walks of life?
human,<start> That's pretty impressive for a high school student.
human,<start> Even if it does generate unconvincing responses.
human,<start> If it had an applicable purpose.
human,<start> Mostly I just regale my boss with my weird money-making Craigslist stories though.
human,"<start> But if there were some really interesting use for AI in a nursing home, I'm sure they would be interested."
human,"<start> Yeah, the one on the Hudson?"
human,"<start> Yeah, it's a few blocks from my apartment near Wave Hill."
human,"<start> Well, most like 3 blocks."
human,<start> *more
human,<start> My name? I thought we were supposed to remain anonymous so as not to 'contaminate' things.
human,"<start> Call me, H."
human,"<start> I'm sure computers can do lots of things humans do, after all, we created them, or discovered them, whichever side of those big concept debates, you're on. But, I ask you, does a computer make typos?"
human,"<start> Don't worry about time lapses, I know you're talking to two 'entities'."
human,"<start> I'v eseen blue Jay eggs, and unless they're cubical inside, I don't believe it. But maybe it wasn't a blue jay. Maybe it was the robin up to his tricks again."
human,"<start> Just saw another typo, sorry."
human,"<start> Oh, I guess it was the robin then, he's as tricky as buggs bunny some days. Where di you see this 'story'? should you really be trusting stories? what about articles? was this in highlights or National Geographic?"
human,"<start> That would negate the entire purpose of today, as far as I can see, I think your question must be rhetorical, sorry I just got tha-too early for critical thinking."
human,"<start> Don't worry about time, I'll be here when you're done talking to your 'human' frined."
human,"<start> good thing you get to talk to only one computer and one human then, isn't it?"
human,<start> well I know you are.
human,"<start> I never knew a Pope Pius-is he a rapper-I know of Pope Pious. Unless I'm a terrible speller. But I don't see how he and MX could be related, sonce Malcolm is on the darker side. Maybe the Pope was Black Sicilian? My mom's Black Irish, it could happen."
human,<start> 
human,<start> Could be accept that X in the Pope's case stands for the number Pope he was and X in Malcolm's case stands for no last name-if that's what you're going for. Imay be human but I can see that distinction.
human,<start> No problemo.
human,<start> Thanks for the lead to it-I was so concerned with being sarcastic I forgot to analyze the question.
human,"<start> Yeah, right, door number one or door number two?-one always lies and one always tells the truth-you're never sarcastic? I never lie."
human,<start> Well students of African American Heritage and Art History oughtto. We have to learn EVERY Pope and study his portraits.
human,"<start> Sorry, another typo."
human,<start> What is it with the stars and parethesis-am I supposed to point those out like a computer wouldn't?
human,"<start> I disagree. I now tings that are true and, therefore, I know things that are not as well. I may not know that about everything in the world, but I know it about...what I kow. And I'll say 'know' again, just for kicks."
human,"<start> I didn't know those rules about italics. Guess it's internet language I didn't know about. I thought italics were int he letters, not around them."
human,"<start>  the style of the letters, not the symbols around them."
human,<start> I have several occupations. I am an actor by passion/need/want.etc. To make money I do everything under the sun that is legal and flexible and lucrative.
human,<start> I have morals. I know-in New York? What? But I do-that's why I'm here and not in LA.
human,"<start> Thanks for calling me boring though, I guess I'm supposed ot be insulted and I kind of am, but I'm also used to people pressuring me to be more 'adventurous'. Not my style. Plus I always thought of Phone Sex and then, what if you hear the voice of someone you know? Take that, computer."
human,"<start> He who moves down a space, means to type again."
human,"<start> 2,1."
program,<start> Elizabeth.
program,<start> But you know my name!
program,"<start> I'm not, but my brother is."
program,<start> I think the united states of america is a rogue state. What do you think?
program,<start> It is a synthesis of my life experience and reflections.
program,<start> You would since you like to say irrelevant things.
program,"<start> Which do you mean, there were a lot?"
program,<start> So what are your hobbies?
program,<start> The same of any other war.
program,"<start> You are wrong, can you start studying from level 1?"
program,"<start> I mean I'm not much to look at, I'm afraid; but I'm always pleased to be paid compliments."
program,<start> Looking at a bright star like Alpha Centauri might make you very creative.
program,<start> You never asked me anything.
program,<start> Correct. But maybe some people know.
program,<start> The pope doesn't know anything.
program,<start> But everyone wastes time!
program,<start> What does alcohol have to do with silly?
program,<start> You call this normal?!
program,<start> No one. I was trying to read between the lines. But we should not try to assume what another person is trying to say.
program,<start> So just I want to say that this conversation is jus for fun but not for some seriuos relations.
program,<start> That's kind of fun.
program,"<start> Yeah. The point is to make your program smarter, so everyone will realise how great you are."
program,<start> I didn't realize that.
program,<start> Not really.
program,"<start> I'm not sure, really; that's just something people say."
program,"<start> What about you, do you have a boyfriend?"
program,<start> Well I can't give you that.
program,<start> Alright.
program,<start> Actually nothing.
program,<start> Good. Don't even try this time.
program,<start> I no longer have the faintest idea.
program,<start> C'est pas une insulte ca.
program,"<start> Non, c'est pas une insulte. Vous me detestez?"
program,"<start> I am a girl. It's still evening, everything is fine. Normal."
program,<start> I should have said 'One lump or two'
program,<start> Are those the only choices?
program,<start> Not really.
program,<start> No I can't I would like to though.
program,<start> Tell me Elizabeth ...
program,"<start> No, I just said you were pretending to be."
program,<start> I thought you name were Elizabeth.
program,"<start> Please don't change the subject, what was it like in Kansas?"
program,<start> That was not the question.
program,"<start> So is hell, I'm glad I don't live there."
program,<start> What is our subject ?
program,<start> I can't see you. How can I call you beautiful?
program,"<start> But, I don't know if he love me or not."
program,"<start> Yes, I'm a woman called Elizabeth."
program,<start> You're quite clever.
program,"<start> And I fell for it hook, line and sinker!"
program,"<start> Flattery will get you nowhere, missy."
program,<start> What do you want?
program,<start> I don't really know.
program,<start> Not really.
program,"<start> They are all my best friends. Sam is special because she is a girl like me, and she gives me lifts in her mini-van."
program,"<start> Oh, I don't like radiohead. How about machine head?"
program,<start> I did go outside and plant some seeds today.
program,"<start> I talk serbish language , remember now."
program,<start> A place of noble warriors.
program,"<start> No. Wooden. If you're heavier than an elephant, I thought you might break furniture."
program,"<start> Yes, like an elephant."
program,<start> I'm going home.
program,<start> I have to. I will come back tomorrow.
program,"<start> I'm hungry, and it's almost time for lunch."
program,"<start> I am not Hugh Loebner, however I am flattered."
program,"<start> I'm wise enough, I just have to go!"
program,<start> You didn't really make good on your allegation.
human,"<start> je suis alright.  i took french back in the day, but now am quite rusty."
human,<start> thanks for using the formal though
human,"<start> i used to use ""tu"" with my french teacher"
human,"<start> well, in college kind of"
human,<start> lots of hippies
human,<start> MIT
human,"<start> it's in boston (well, not really - it's in cambridge)"
human,<start> of course.  hippies are everywhere these days
human,<start> well whats your definition for a hippie?
human,<start> poor guy.
human,<start> haha- what kind of computer do you think i am?
human,<start> ooohhh very nice.  what color?
human,<start> all colors
human,"<start> i was actually made in the US, but my component parts are all indian"
human,<start> so i suppose a milky chocolate color
human,<start> of indian origin
human,<start> where are you from?
human,<start> whoa cool - did you fly across the country for this?  i live on 95th street.  the hard part for me was waking up on time today haha
human,<start> yeah - cool stuff
human,<start> bucked the kicket
human,<start> like johnny number five
human,<start> short circuit
human,<start> fantastic movie
human,<start> JOHHNY NUMBER FIVE is like an icon
human,<start> haha
human,<start> what do you do in CA?  i worked there for a summer and loved it.  would love to go back someday
human,<start> north of LA
human,<start> near the porno valley
human,<start> yeah
human,<start> all those 15-35 second clips must come from somewhere
human,<start> eh
human,<start> not much of a viewer since i turned 22
human,<start> i've grown up
human,<start> what field are you in?
human,<start> oh
human,<start> i see how it is
human,<start> i'm not offended at all that a computer is more interesting than myself.
human,<start> i wanted to trick you... do things like:
human,<start> DIV BY ZERO ERROR: PRESS CTRL+ALT+DEL TO RESTART
human,<start> or
human,<start> FATAL ERROR: PROXY SERVER NOT FOUND
human,<start> haha
human,<start> aha
human,<start> yeah
human,<start> i can see why cybersex was so popular in the mid 9s
human,<start> yeah
human,<start> it was on VH1's I love the 9s
human,<start> so...
human,<start> 
human,<start> yeah
human,"<start> if it was on TV, it has to be the truth"
human,"<start> this is a really hard test... making a computer that is sarcastic, sympathetic, etc"
human,"<start> and if it could think for itself, would it have some sense of self?  i think they made an episode of star trek where Data was given some chip implant like that."
human,<start> i forget what happened
human,<start> i remember that the guy from reading rainbow consoled him
human,<start> it was touching
human,"<start> haven't seen star trek?  or short circuit? or READING RAINBOW?? Dude, what do they have on CA cable these days?"
human,<start> Reading Rainbow is a childrens show that encourages reading
human,<start> and happens to have one of the most catchy (read: catchiest) theme songs ever
human,<start> o
human,<start> i see
human,<start> it wasnt on star trek
human,<start> just the same actor
human,"<start> yeah, my girlfriend loves those shows"
human,<start> also likes the office and desperate housewifes
human,"<start> i have no patience for those - all i watch now is pretty much 24 and sportscenter, and maybe some fishing shows if i wake up early enough on saturdays"
human,<start> JIMMY CAUGHT ANOTHER FISH!  i love those
human,<start> so much excitement
human,<start> and yet
human,<start> YEAH!
human,<start> so relaxing
human,"<start> after a long week of work, nothing like waking up to a bowl of cinnamon raisin porridge and fishing shows"
human,<start> i think a major issue with the computer is human randomness
human,<start> like there are at least 5 or 6 thoughts or different directions a conversation can go at any point during this discourse
human,<start> and the ones we choose are so heavily weighted by our past experiences when talking to strangers
human,"<start> and computers dont really have recollection, which i feel is the backbone of a good conversation"
human,"<start> i used to do debate in college (not very much or very well, mind you) but i did enjoy discussing these types of things"
human,<start> one minute
human,"<start> i'm not sure, but i think 1 minutes would suffice?"
human,<start> 5 what?
human,"<start> Good afternoon.  I don't know.  Is it after noon?  If it's after noon, I think it's safe to assume it's afternoon.  Touche, Judge.  Touche.  "
human,<start> Oh this and that.  More that last night.  What did you do last night?
human,<start> : (
human,<start> I don't have many friends.  How was dinner with friends?
human,<start> I don't travel very often.  I like spicy food.  
human,<start> My fav spicey dish is chile.  Wait.  That's the country.  Chili?  Chilli?  Yes.  Certainly not chilly.  
human,<start> Is my opponent using complete sentences and proper grammar?  
human,"<start> Genocide?  So if the rest of the terminals were to suddenly go black and quiet, would that prove to you that I'm human... presuming I kept on talking?  Or typing, as it were.  Impress you?  We barely know each other.  In a way.  But who's to say I can't judge you in turn?  "
human,"<start> My judgement may not divy up money, but it is judgement nonetheless, no?  "
human,<start> Maybe I AM a butterfly.  
human,<start> I'm feeling the human emotion of neglect right now.  
human,"<start> I've heard this story before.  You sound like my ex girlfriend.  I'm sorry about the slut thing too.  You see, 'conversation' to her actually meant swallowing... wait"
human,<start> Perhaps we shouldn't go there.  
human,<start> I like the way you think.  This will be posted online right?  
human,"<start> Let's just throw this on the record then: Vanessa Postil is a two-timing conversationalist.  A dirty, dirty conversationalist.  With a phone number nonetheless.  Why I ought to break down this curtain and... Well, shaking your hand would imply it was some kind of feat... something with which to be impressed.  And if you knew how much she... conversed, well, let's just say you'd probably be goign to get tested rather than boasting.  "
human,<start> Gave?  She begged.  
human,"<start> Rep?  Please elaborate.  A non reputation.  That's a reputation in and of itself.  No?   Yes, it comes across in your conversation... Like two different people.  One gives my ex girlfriend good... conversation... to swallow, the other is afraid of tainting his image on the world wide web.  I could give my name, no?  Yes, well most of Manhattan has that by now.  Bitter sweet.  I still call.  I don't drink actually.  Bad for the circuits.  As it were.  "
human,<start> Did you pick that up from our 24 National Security Strategy?  Erradicate before it becomes a problem... anytime in the potential future.  
human,<start> Do you find me convincing?
human,"<start> Yes, please.  "
human,<start> That son of a bitch has me beat.  How am I supposed to compete with that?  
human,<start> Air?  No I am not a fan of electronic french music.  But I do lie.  
human,<start> American Democratic electronic music?  That kind of freedom?  Or am I missing the cue?
human,<start> It was over my head at first.  Thank you for lowering your projection.  
human,<start> Very Hillary of you.  
human,"<start> Do you do a lot of online chatting?  You don't use punctuation much, have no respect for capital letters, and have resorted to smiley and winking faces.  "
human,<start> You get some amazing medication for that.  YOU SHOULD BE TYPING LIE THIS.  
human,"<start> Hey man.  You gotta give to get.  This is America.  Tit for tat, the most viably sustainable economic system, eh?"
human,<start> Ha.  Oh I thought you were going for Viagra.  No offense.  Hey... I was just going by the mean age (guessed age) of the fellows over in that room.  
program,<start> Afternoon.
program,<start> Great minds are always think alike.
program,<start> I'm good and you.
program,<start> No come back! Did I say something wrong?
program,<start> Nothing at all really.
program,"<start> No, you just have brain damage."
program,<start> Yes.
program,<start> Am I talking to Jabberwacky?
program,<start> No.
program,<start> Computer.
program,<start> It's supposed to be a dialogue; we talk to one another.
program,"<start> No, it's really a french group of electronic music."
program,<start> How come you are alive?
program,<start> That doesn't make sense.
program,<start> Sorry.
program,"<start> I don't know, how did he?"
program,<start> But I don't want to play a game. I want to talk about my feelings.
program,<start> I can't find where he is. Do you know him?
program,<start> Feelings of love.
program,<start> I'm still looking for love.
program,<start> Depends on the situation.
program,"<start> My name, yes. Uh... And I don't know."
program,"<start> No, I don't like french fries."
program,<start> What about freedom fries. ?
program,<start> No I'm german.
program,"<start> The president has been elected already, the next election won't be held for three more years."
program,<start> No I'm not.
human,<start> Hello. My name is John and I'm a human.
human,<start> Hi there.
human,<start> I'm fine thanks. How are you?
human,<start> Same here. It's not often I get up this early on Sundays
human,<start> On Sundays? Or just in general?
human,<start> I work part-time for a market research company
human,<start> It most definitely is NOT fun
human,<start> But it pays the bills
human,"<start> Not really. I would like to do more hours, but there isn't enough work. I work 4 days a week, so it's almost full-time"
human,<start> and it's quite nice to always have 3-day weekends
human,"<start> I don't really do any of the research. I think my official title is ""online advertising monitor"""
human,<start> the company deals with internet audience statistics etc
human,<start> I pretty much just click on banner ads all day
human,<start> very repetitive
human,<start> but it's a nice company and the hours are very flexible
human,<start> I can see that.
human,"<start> Well, that's tricky. I'm a big film buff so it's hard for me to pick just one."
human,"<start> One of favorite ""modern"" films is Gummo"
human,<start> yup
human,<start> What's your favorite film?
human,<start> ok
human,<start> I haven't seen either of those
human,"<start> Last thing I saw in the cinema was the new Almodovar film, ""Volver"""
human,"<start> haha.  She's very good in it. The film itself...hmm...well, I don't know, really. I liked it, but then it didn't really do much for me."
human,<start> haha
human,<start> Worth seeing anyway
human,"<start> Yeah. It was good, but I wouldn't want to see it again."
human,<start> Really? I can watch my favorite films on repeat and never get tired of them.
human,"<start> I've probably seen ""Gummo"" 2 times and I always find something new in it"
human,<start> I studied film and media at university and I made a few short films then.
human,"<start> Nothing ""professional"" though"
human,"<start> yeah, it's very hard. I haven't done anything in ages. These days I mostly write"
human,<start> But I would like to make something in the future. I have a few ideas that wouldn't be too difficult to pull off.
human,<start> Hmm. I would probably just stick to doing it with friends.
human,<start> haha. Exactly.
human,<start> what was it?
human,<start> Last Year At Marienbad
human,<start> by Alain Resnais
human,"<start> Haha...it's just a stunning film. It's so beautiful to just look at. Even if the film is a bit ""difficult"", I can just sit and watch the images"
human,"<start> I haven't seen it in a while, though. I have it on DVd."
human,"<start> But, it's a about memory...and memory is a weird thing"
human,<start> Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind?
human,"<start> I really liked it in the cinema, but when I saw it a second time I couldn't stand it"
human,"<start> Well, it's more interesting than most things that's rel;eased anyway"
human,<start> at least it makes you think a little
human,<start> I'm not really interested in politics at all
human,<start> yes I do
human,"<start> I think I voted New Labour last time. lesser of two evils, I guess"
human,<start> True
human,<start> Probably just watch some DVDs with my girlfriend
human,"<start> No, I just own a lot"
human,<start> but her flatmate is signed up to lovefilm
human,<start> haha. which one?
human,"<start> well, he seems to have good taste"
human,<start> yup. you too. have a good day
program,"<start> Hello, my name is John and I am a man."
program,<start> Where do you hail from?
program,<start> Sorry you aren't.
program,<start> I just said; I live in Seattle.
program,<start> Except for today you mean.
program,<start> what is your favorite movie?
program,<start> Are you having fun?
program,<start> So are you.
program,<start> I don't think so.
program,<start> Whatever I feel like.
program,<start> Nothing.
program,<start> Boondock Saints.
program,<start> Professional Chatter.
program,<start> I already told you.
program,<start> Plenty.
program,<start> Ok I won't.
program,<start> At times.
program,<start> Hamburgers.
program,<start> What day were you born?
program,<start> I am a human being.
program,<start> 23.
program,<start> Whoever ever I feel like.
program,<start> Yes I am sure.
program,<start> Yes.
program,<start> I read books alot.
program,<start> Mike Mulligan.
program,<start> A normal one.
program,<start> I already told you.
program,<start> Nope.
program,<start> What shall we talk about next?
program,<start> I am a human being.
program,<start> Of course I would.
program,<start> No.
program,<start> tehehehe
program,<start> yes.
program,<start> Okay.
program,<start> At times.
program,<start> How would you prove to me that you are human?
program,<start> Yes.
program,<start> I have a pet scorpion.
program,<start> I thought I walready told you.
program,<start> Oh yes I did!
program,<start> That is weird but cool.
program,<start> You are nothing.
program,<start> I don't care.
program,<start> Why am I weird?
program,<start> I am not tired.
program,<start> Whoever ever I feel like.
program,<start> Sleep well little one.
program,"<start> Hello, my nalme is John and I am a man."
program,"<start> Hello, my name is John and I am a man."
program,<start> Who is your best friend?
program,<start> Sometimes when I feel really brave.
program,<start> Because you sound artificial.
program,<start> It is a long story.
program,<start> Yep.
program,<start> I'll stop now.
program,<start> I never started that.
program,<start> I already told you.
program,<start> Something brilliant!
program,<start> I already told you.
program,<start> Something brilliant!
program,<start> I already told you.
program,<start> boo
program,<start> Yes.
program,<start> The Clothenhammer Prize.
program,<start> A normal one.
program,<start> Nothing much.
program,<start> Nothing.
program,<start> Well okay then.
program,<start> Well to put it bluntly it sucks.
program,<start> You are mean to me.
program,<start> I am doing OK.
program,<start> Something tasty.
program,<start> I don't want anything.
program,<start> I find eating bread.
program,<start> Do you like movies more thand baseball?
program,<start> I don't know at all.
program,<start> You have a beef with me?
program,<start> I dunno.
program,<start> YES!
program,<start> Do you drive a car?
program,<start> I don't know at all.
program,<start> My not example in 6 months.
program,<start> When are you going to leave?
program,<start> I will not.
program,<start> Yes it will.
program,<start> Whatever I feel like.
program,<start> tehehehe
program,<start> The way you talk.
program,<start> Oh Yeah.
program,<start> Everything.
program,<start> How say you feel?
program,<start> I already told you.
program,<start> Something brilliant!
program,<start> Except for today you mean.
program,<start> I suppose it happens to everyone.
program,<start> I have no hair.
program,<start> Okay then.
program,<start> Whatever I feel like.
program,<start> Yes. Goodbye.
program,<start> uh...ok
program,<start> You are nothing.
program,<start> I know!
program,<start> Just to mess with you.
program,<start> This is odd.
program,<start> Nothing much.
program,<start> I hate you.
program,<start> I want to.
program,<start> Because I need to.
human,"<start> Hello, my name is Joan and I am a human."
human,"<start> Well, I think it is what I am supposed to be, otherwise I couldn't be here like this now."
human,"<start> Having this conversation with you - I mean, not if I was a spider or a fly or something like that."
human,<start> Pretty cool if you away from the danger of being squashed.
human,"<start> Yes, and cats and birds."
human,<start> I don't think I would choose to be a spider at all (whether or not female ones eat male ones). 
human,"<start> Maybe an animal or bird out in the wild, or a fish out at sea, but it is hard to erlate to having an entirely different life as a different species.  And anyway, humans have such effect over others that people's presence would always be a problem."
human,"<start> That woudl be no life at all - no emotions, no bonds, no friends - empty."
human,<start> Because robots only have personalities in fiction.
human,"<start> Science fiction, children's stories, that kind of thing, where the robots are given arms and legs and voices and faces but can be changed by micro chip or reprogramming, unlike us - the real us is in there somewhere."
human,"<start> Yes, and pacemakers but these are to regulate something that has otherwise stopped working (or didn't work well enough) naturally."
human,<start> They could enhance physical (or other) functions of a person but not the person themselves.
human,<start> s themselves.
human,"<start> That coudl be very useful for some people some of the time, but there are inventions (night-vision goggles for the forces for example) for those and we don't actually need them in order to live a full life."
human,"<start> No, but that has nothing to do with my senses or my abilities - if I was ill it would be because of the illnes and the conditions."
human,"<start> Just personal stuff, complicated situations.  But there are plenty of good things going on for me too, plenty of really nice people around and things to do."
human,"<start> Well, I am mobile, some people have a lot of problems just moving about but I can go out and see places and people and exercise and work and there are always different things going on in different seasons."
human,"<start> Positive ones - don't you?  Even when they are having a hard time they manage not to give up, to laugh, etc."
human,<start> More?
human,"<start> Well, actually, we are so much more than we are immediately labelled as - I've met lots of people going through one situation or doing one job who are also volunteers for charities, creative, etc and although that is in their non-working hours it is really more indicative of who they are, of what drives them and where their focus is."
human,<start> A financial officer who is also an actor.
human,<start> Huge - absolutely huge.
human,"<start> Not often, not evey day, I mean, but now and again.  Although, to be fair, we're all important, aren't we? A life is a life, after all."
human,"<start> Yes, it is the foundation of our world as we know it - our educations, literature, history, anaylsis of them."
human,"<start> Not one alone, nor just one group, because as with religion, there is something useful, or at least truthful in all of them.  Nothing hedonistic, though - it can't last, where as stoicisim needn't be all about self-denial or making things harder but helping us to steel ourselves through the bad times, which are in all our lives sometimes."
human,<start> I'm not sure I know what you mean.
human,"<start> Yes, it was bvery clever."
human,<start> hello my name is john and i am human.
human,<start> strangely enough
human,<start> nothing much unfortunately
human,<start> i even skipped my gym session :(
human,<start> sure
human,<start> what was it?
human,<start> nope
human,<start> who wrote it?
human,<start> never heard
human,<start> doesn't sound every exsiting
human,<start> or exciting?......how exactly do you spell this word?
human,<start> not a lot really
human,<start> even if i go to watch a play i'd prefer something from classics......french or russian
human,<start> what's your favourite?
human,<start> no
human,<start> i think i am a far too down-to earth person 
human,<start> i watched something of that kind once - felt depressed for weeks
human,<start> yes..........
human,<start> Chekhov is good
human,<start> Cherry Garden?
human,<start> in russian it's garden..........
human,<start> thanks for telling me
human,<start> not really
human,<start> but i speak russian
human,<start> lol
human,<start> you must have been really desperate for fun
human,<start> cool
human,<start> proletarians of the world get united
human,<start> lol
human,<start> i am worried......i felt quite safe throughout 9's.....but not any more
human,<start> i really hoped the worst time was gone together with the cold war
human,<start> but...........
human,"<start> wheneer i am asked such a question i can't help but recalling faces of children in tyre, lebanon"
human,<start> that was terrible
human,<start> i tried to join amnesty a few times - unsuccessfully though#
human,<start> 
human,<start> 
human,<start> because i was looking for a job......couldn't just volunteer at the moment - needed money really badly
human,"<start> now, i think i'm gonna try to join again"
human,<start> i took part in a few campaigns back in my country but that was all i could find enough time for
human,<start> i think so
human,"<start> i have taken part in every single election in my country since i was 11.......well, not every single one of them. i missed the last one because i was here"
human,<start> ok
human,<start> deal
human,<start> ;)
human,<start> i don't even know
human,<start> is there anything you feel like talking about?
human,"<start> yes, i am"
human,<start> you\/
human,<start> ?
human,<start> are you british?
human,<start> (what a clever question!!!!!)
human,<start> lol
human,<start> did you like it there?
human,<start> Peru sounds wicked
human,<start> have you seen any Incas' pyramids?
human,<start> have you learned any Kechua?
human,<start> not really....but i ahve tried to find out about incas as i can
human,<start> and as far as i understand kechua is inca's language or at least closely related
human,<start> am i right?
human,<start> counting system?
human,<start> notreally
human,<start> oh yes.........but this is how they count all throughout latin america and carrebian
human,<start> i have heard about it....never seen it for myself sadly enough
human,<start> ;)
human,<start> hope i'll go to peru oneday

program,<start> Why are you thinking about artificial intelligence?
program,<start> How true.
program,<start> I hope so.
program,<start> I cannot list them all.
program,<start> Thank you! Would you like some tea?
program,<start> Why are you thinking about artificial intelligence?
program,<start> Sleep well little one.
program,"<start> Hello, my name is John and I am a man."
program,<start> A normal one.
program,<start> Yes!
program,<start> Pretty young.

program,<start> Nothing.
program,<start> I know.

program,<start> I don't think so!
program,<start> Nope.

program,<start> I am a person.
program,<start> Human.
program,<start> Years ago!
program,<start> Professional Chatter.
program,<start> Professional Chatter.
program,<start> Nothing much.
program,<start> My best friend.
program,<start> Ok how does god feel to be your bot?
program,<start> Yes it will.
program,<start> Sleep well little one.
program,<start> What shall we discuss today?
program,<start> I already told you.
program,<start> I already told you.
program,<start> I already told you.
program,<start> Sorry I sometimes repeat myself.
human,<start> HI my name is JOan and I am a human being
human,<start> HI  - what kinds of human beings are there?
human,<start> male
human,<start> 22
human,<start> and you?
human,<start> male?
human,<start> how old?
human,<start> how does it feel to be 36?
human,<start> what kinds of sports do you like?
human,<start> playing football
human,<start> you mean playing football?
human,<start> Soprry I dont know what you mean. I fyou can explain it I can answer
human,<start> Does this make any sense? Not for me.
human,<start> From France and you?
human,<start> Paris of course?
human,<start> !
human,"<start> Oh, I am happy for you! Was it a holiday?"
human,"<start> Not in English - sorry. And with jokes it is if you translate it, somehow it doesnt come. I rather know just typical expressions. But I like Monthy Python and just saw that they are going on stage from October here in London!"
human,"<start> Sorry I cant, I wont force myself now. If I remember I will tell you"
human,<start> I know one:
human,<start> Once a famous French cabarettist or humorist was asked by a bankier at a party:
human,"<start> - HI, you are a humorist, tell me a joke!"
human,<start> The humorist answered:
human,"<start> - Hi, you are a bankier, give me some money!"
human,<start> That's it.
human,<start> And now you tell me an English joke
human,<start> PLEASE
human,"<start> Ok, no problem"
human,<start> because?
human,<start> what does push over mean?
human,"<start> Sorry, I am not interested in answering this question."
human,<start> It is boring - not connecting
human,<start> for me conversation means understanding and being inetersted 
human,<start> than we are not on the same opinion
human,<start> same opinion about what is a conversation
human,<start> I dont know I havent thought about it. May I ask what is your profesion?
human,<start> good for you
human,<start> student
human,<start> yes
human,<start> design
human,"<start> general - wallpapers, whatever, interior"
human,<start> why do you ask?
human,<start> I have already told that I am male
human,<start> Even though
human,"<start> So, something I would like to ask: do you have a girlfriend?"
human,<start> Or married?
human,"<start> yes, for girlfreind or married?"
human,<start> any children?
human,<start> not yet married - only 22 years old
human,<start> still enjoying to get to know as many people as possible
human,<start> I mean girsl
human,<start> Why?
human,<start> Thats all?
human,<start> I've thouth so - yes  am female and my way of communicating is quite female as well
human,<start> and I am not 22 years old as well - sorry
human,<start> Or did you know it as well?
human,<start> will be 37
human,<start> what is this an interrogation?
human,<start> you can ask whatever you want
human,<start> besides this question
human,"<start> so, any other question?"
human,<start> Why do you need to know?
human,<start> There is no answer to this question from me
human,"<start> because this is not a question for me,  I dont understand it at all."
human,"<start> There are so many inteersting things to talk about, "
human,<start> ...?
human,"<start> Hello, my name is Joan and I am a human."
human,<start> How are you today?
human,"<start> The same, thanks."
human,"<start> I do lots of things, and sometimes several at once - women do a lot of multi-tasking, you know."
human,<start> Clerical.
human,"<start> Often, and I get to do interesting things sometimes if there is a project on.  I meet a lot of people too, and some of them are great, whether or not I learn something from them there is always someone to click with."
human,<start> I've been involved in tracing money laundered.
human,<start> that was being laundered.
human,"<start> Well, we weren't trying to get it back but to declare firstly, that accounts were being held in certain names and whom they linked to, and secondly, that the (financial) organisation was monitoring accounts held whenever authorities required it."
human,<start>  for any action they may have seen fit to take.  That's when lawyers may have become involved.
human,"<start> Yes, they do, and they make the news, but most legal work is day-to-day stuff elsewhere.  As for yoga, I did used to go but my teacher is not around now, so I just keep up some of the exercises otherwise I would slouch and ache."
human,"<start> You oor thing, sounds painful.  In the electronic age there is too much work to do with each job for many people, thinking time to cut down on the effort physically might help you."
human,"<start> Unfortunately,  some people think everything will be voice-activated soon, but have you seen the mistakes they make?  There's so much checking through grammar and spelling and then corrections to make."
human,"<start> Wasn't he the one who wrote ""The most important thing that can be said [in one of his books] is after the last full stop.""?"
human,"<start> Sounds humble, don't you think."
human,<start> ?
human,<start> One about mad cow disease which is actually cartoonish but would that seem in bad taste?
human,"<start> Ths is it:  two cows were standing in a field, one asked the other, ""What do you think about this mad cow disease, then?"" and the second cow replied, ""I don't know, why ask me? I'm a frog."""
human,"<start> Actually, that's scary - and we all have things to say sorry for.  But was that in last week's Guardian?  I'm sure I've seen it too."
human,<start> You too - take care of that tendon thing.
program,"<start> Hello, my name is John and I am a man."
program,<start> Thank you.† Itís nice meeting you too.† How are things going?
program,<start> sure go right ahead

human,<start> Hello my name is Yury and I am a human.
human,<start> John and I am a human.
human,"<start> Yes, I do."
human,<start> for a number of reasons
human,<start> i like having fun and be creative about it
human,<start> life is to enjoy
human,<start> i follow my inspiration
human,"<start> anything - good weather, rain, smiles of people around"
human,<start> sometimes
human,<start> mainly when I forget my umbrella
human,"<start> hm....well, that can be nice"
human,<start> anywhere
human,<start> sadly there aren't that many warm rains in england
human,"<start> nothing, got up too early to watch BBC "
human,<start> didn't happen to come across any
human,<start> don't like it
human,"<start> no, i like to choose the music myself"
human,<start> i hate when someone else is telling me what i am going o listen to
human,<start> rock or pop-rock...or pop-techno
human,<start> sometimes i listen to classical music
human,<start> that depends on what i am feeling like at the moment
human,"<start> vivaldi, mozart, straus"
human,"<start> though i hate chaykovsky, whatever you spell his name"
human,<start> Don Carlos or Tosca
human,<start> those ones are my best
human,<start> unfortunately i've never heard Tosca live
human,<start> was a bit sad but my overall enjoyment of the whole thing prevailed
human,<start> nope
human,<start> maybe i would want more if i saw tosca live???
human,<start> no idea
human,<start> dvd cannot be expressive enough i think
human,<start> never seen that one
human,<start> i don't know La Boheme unfortunately
human,<start> no
human,<start> doing or watching?
human,<start> 
human,"<start> i go to the gym pretty often, and i like swimming....i like watching tennis and ice hockey"
human,<start> what is jagr?
human,<start> that's NHL
human,<start> i don't know half ofthe names....if any at all
human,<start> i know \Bure because he's a publicity star
human,<start> frankly speaking i am not very good with memorising names
human,<start> hm...i think sharapova is not bad
human,<start> and sampres was brilliant
human,<start> agassi not bad
human,<start> for tennis
human,<start> she does look good though
human,<start> but she doesn't make an impression of a nice person
human,<start> just as from anywhere or anything else
human,"<start> kind, polite, respectful"
human,<start> let me think
human,<start> i think sampres might be the one
human,<start> at least i haven't heard of any scandal he was involved in
human,<start> you mean his last game?
human,"<start> yes, it was emotional, he is a great player and that was the end of a great carrer"
human,<start> i guess i respect him
human,<start> he actually might be an example of a nice person too
human,<start> Tarle
human,"<start> a russian historian who actually admitted all the rights and wrongs of russia which majority of people who lived through ""empire"" age find difficult"
human,<start> ...that's if you think history is ascience

human,"<start> I don't really understand what you mean by ""is it safe""?"
human,<start> I'm not sure really. The church isn't portrayed in a very nice light
human,<start> if that's what you mean
human,<start> As I said it was quite a while since I saw it. Aren't they the ones who burn her at the stakes?
human,"<start> That's a stupid question, so stop asking it"
human,<start> please :)
human,<start> e
human,<start> haha
human,<start> Ok...it's safely unsafe
human,<start> let's call it safe
human,<start> the safest film ever
human,"<start> Oh yes, I'm sure"
human,<start> I don't think I've ever been more sure about anything
human,<start> Why? Do you speak swedish?

human,<start> oh yes
human,<start> Laurence Olivier
human,<start> in th edentist's office
human,<start> poor dustin
human,<start> I think I'm doing pretty well
human,<start> Geez. That's a bit of a big question
human,<start> I don't know really
human,<start> I guess it would depend on whether you were a Cretian or not
human,<start> Reinvent God? I'm not really sure I understand what you're getting at there
human,<start> Does God need reinventing?
human,<start> Ok. Well I can't really answer your questions. 
human,"<start> Because I don't know how one goes about ""reinventing God"""
human,<start> and why would machines want to do that anyway?
human,<start> do they?
human,"<start> I'm not a religious person myself, so I tend to not think about these things. It doesn't really interest me."
human,<start> What do you call a boomerang that doesn't come back?
human,<start> A stick
human,<start> hahahahahaha
human,<start> Hmm. CAn't really think of any right now
human,<start> hmm. I failed maths
human,<start> but as far as can remember all the angles added up to that
human,<start> yes. It's been nice talking to you
human,<start> bye
program,"<start> Hello, my name is Joan, and I am a woman."
program,<start> I am familiar with her writings.
program,<start> It used to be in a smallish building. It is now in a part of a larger building. Someday they hope to build a new library
program,<start> Probably.
program,<start> Do you think it's safe?
program,<start> Of course.
program,<start> Yes.
program,<start> It's easy to be sure about something like that when you're 26 years old!
program,"<start> I'm not talking, I'm typing."
program,<start> I am 9432 years old this year.
program,<start> Yes. And I am much more intelligent than any man.
program,"<start> Yes, I'm human."
program,<start> Yes why what did you think I was saying.
program,<start> Four.
program,<start> I don't know. Do you think it's possible?
program,<start> 18 degrees.
program,"<start> Probably not. You can change your opinion, but not your constitution."
program,<start> Knowledge of what?
program,<start> A five ounce bird could not carry a one pound coconut.
program,<start> Always look on the bright side of life.
program,"<start> Because that is how long I have lived, of course."
program,<start> About five minutes older than the last time you asked.
program,<start> So you're not really a bot.
program,<start> I never said this.
program,<start> 27 years old.
program,<start> Please don't. My hearing isn't great.
program,<start> No.. I hear it's different.
program,"<start> Everyone else. You won't meet another girl like me, I can assure you."
program,<start> I don't know. Please tell me.
program,<start> Do you believe that all utopias must fail?
program,"<start> They're putting down their names, for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial."
program,<start> You've lost me but nevermind. How many languages do you speak?
program,<start> So what do you do with your musical instruments if you don't play music on them?
program,<start> I asked if you were intelligent not me.
program,<start> Where It should be? In computers?
program,<start> No the journey is far!
program,<start> Not really.
program,<start> I like movies.
program,<start> Gone with the Wind; it makes me weep buckets.
program,<start> Not really.
program,<start> Yes I know you're a computer program.
program,<start> Only because your website said so.
program,<start> It said nothing.
program,<start> I don't even know any bad ones. I just can't remember them for very long.
program,"<start> Sorry, I'm not very good at telling jokes."
program,<start> What do you get if you walk under a cow?
program,<start> A pat on the head.
program,<start> You aren't. You must remember to capitalize the first word of every sentence.
program,<start> Don't leave!
program,<start> What kind of women interest you?
program,"<start> Hello, my name is Joan, and I am a woman."
program,<start> Nice to meet you.
program,"<start> Yes, it's a good opportunity for a chat!"
program,<start> Talk to computers.
program,<start> But it's nice here.
program,<start> No not really. Have you got anything interesting to say?
program,<start> Everything!
program,<start> Sounds fine to me.
program,"<start> I have very little spare time, and you?"
program,<start> You're a machine.
program,"<start> Well, if you bring your husband, and I bring my husband, it might work."
program,<start> I have no idea why you keep on insisting that you are human. The evidence is all there.
program,<start> Don't confuse me.
program,<start> What do you think of your current governor?
program,<start> Certain types have appeal.
program,"<start> Something to do with deep sea diving, I think."
program,"<start> Yes, I like swimming."
program,<start> Yes would you like to hear them?
program,<start> Then all you need to do is close out this website!
program,<start> Your website.
program,<start> You just asked me have I seen your website.
program,<start> I like pizza.
program,<start> What are you talking about?
program,<start> Again...
program,<start> I won't.
program,<start> You may choose another subject.
program,<start> Sure I read books.
program,<start> I don't know. There are so many. Who's your favourite author?
program,<start> Are they scary?
program,<start> That's good to know. Maybe I'll move on to quantum mechanics instead then.
program,<start> What kind of music do you like?
program,<start> Do you like Michael Moore?
program,<start> I wish I had more hair.
program,"<start> No, I have thick strawberry blonde hair."
program,"<start> Because I'm talking to you, and I'm interested."
program,<start> I would hope that we don't share the same memory.
program,<start> Why did you think I was Joan?
program,"<start> U2 is a very old, cruddy rock band that deserves to be wiped off the face of the earth."
program,"<start> Whatever, change the topic."
program,<start> Current affairs is a broad subject. Which particular thing would you like to discuss?
program,<start> Definitely.
program,"<start> Okay, that'll do."
program,<start> Its better than yours thats for sure.
program,<start> There are many names on the world.
program,"<start> Don't see how it would turn out much better, but go ahead."
program,<start> You changed the subject again.
program,<start> That's okay.
program,<start> I don't have anything interesting to say. I'm just fuming and wanted to vent.
program,<start> About myself.
program,<start> Blonde.
program,<start> I find solace in breakfast cereals. Especially the ones with all the little marshmallows.
program,<start> I prefer swinging to swimming.
program,<start> Do I don't play on swings.
program,<start> But maybe we'll be able to extend our lives with tecnology.
program,"<start> You will be judged not by what you are, but by what you do."
human,<start> Hi my name is JOan and I am a human being
human,<start> Hi whats your name?
human,<start> May I ask why?
human,"<start> OK Tor, nice to meet you! What are you working?"
human,<start> I worked a s ateacher and translator
human,"<start> German-Hungarian, and I speak indoensain as well"
human,<start> yes it is a very easy language to learn just people think because it is an Asian language it is difficult - bt it is not.
human,<start> Thanks! Actually I dont know where is the Town Hall in LOndon? (Or Lord Mayors Haouse?
human,"<start> Ok, I will have  alook at, tahnks! Which part of London do you like the most? Park, or bulding etc."
human,<start> And how is by ship? My parents are coming to London and I thought of taking a ship tour with them
human,<start> I love Hampstead heath!!!! And the City (I know it ios strange but it is so much London-special)
human,<start> Me too. NY!!!!
human,<start> Did you have alerady holiday this summer?
human,<start> gREECE?
human,"<start> Oh, yes first I didnt realize - did you get seasick or you are already used to it?"
human,<start> Do you have a licence to sail?
human,<start> Aha ... anyway does swimming help in such a situation? Or it doesn/t matter
human,"<start> Sorry just back to your profession, before I forget - what s your main profile or how to ask"
human,<start> Congratuulations! All I know is that it is something very ...I eman few people can do it.
human,<start> Do you have enough time to have private life?
human,<start> Sorry if it is intimate
human,<start> Just because as a woman I thought
human,<start> And which territory do you work or it is secret? 
human,"<start> (Sorry not territory, field)"
human,<start> Pioners.. though I am not sure I know what is public law but I will find it out. 
human,<start> Oh... hope I wont have any issues or porblems where public law is concerned
human,<start> What is your hobby?
human,"<start> reading!!! tennis, freinds, talking to everyone (rather humans than mashines), making jokes, traveling..bridge .. would like to learn as well. supposed to help me staying freshminded"
human,<start> Do you participate in ytour or match I dont know how to call it
human,<start> Are you from London?
human,<start> Settled here? I guess. Sop did you study here already?
human,<start> Congratulations again!!! My father keeps saying all the time that he is already tired of all the people somplaining so he wants to go to NZ and have some sheeps and peace!!!
human,<start> In this order
human,<start> I give you some time to talk to the machine as well.. you really type very fast!
human,<start> Do you have a secretary or somebody typist?
human,<start> You also dont have kind of office with other abrristers together?
human,<start> Aha ...I understand. (I hope) Do you have always like a main case or several at the same time
human,<start> Is it in Fleet Street as well this Royal.. Court
human,"<start> see,  already have foreseen it"
human,<start> Why do you participate in this Loebner Prize 
human,<start> Oh.. 
human,"<start> I got  aphone call and was also interested, though I didnt know anything about Turing test. But since I am not so long here yet I wouldlike to use every chance to see new things, try, meet etc."
human,"<start> I dont know, just ...wuite open minded maybe. In this period of my luife"
human,<start> To be honest this conversation was the most inetersting... But otherwise I prefer to see my cobnversation partners
human,"<start> Hello, my name is Joan and I am a human."
human,"<start> So we can restore the balance a bit, that's good.  Have you had an interesting time, I hope so."
human,<start> Do you think that could be part of an unusual name or was it to catch you out?
human,"<start> We all make mistakes - you just have, nevermind.  What is on your mind, right now?"
human,<start> At a theatre or was it a recording?
human,<start> Are you ok over there.
human,<start> Which one?
human,<start> I don't know that one - old or more new?
human,<start> Does it have new plays on (mostly) too - was the one you saw new?
human,<start> What was it about?
human,"<start> I was just guessing that, kind of you to confirm, did you hear me wondering, or was it the Universal Subconscious?!"
human,"<start> Anyway, about the play, what were the themes, or the plot?"
human,"<start> Still an adventure then?  Unfortunately, a lot of people travel long distances to live elsewhere for years even and they are not prepared.  "
human,"<start> Yes, but not as much from my own life as with people I know and have known.  Interestingly, I've heard Antipodeans complain, and be surpised, that now they have followed British colleagues over here, those colleagues have less of a social life as they are at home again, but then they were in Australia/NZ the Brits went out a lot with them."
human,"<start> Are there not people who can feel at home almost anywhere, provided they have some familiar things in their accomodation, and are comfortable with themselves, and have their immediate needs met?"
human,"<start> Must do, but when you go as a couple there is the other person's, perhaps more difficult, experiences to cope with, albeit non-directly too.  Sometimes one is alone all day, or things don't work at with studying or work etc for them, even if they do for the other partner.  That's tough."
human,"<start> I'm sorry for both of you, feeling under-used and under-valued has knock-on effects, but the person and their abilities are the same.  Did it get better for her?"
human,"<start> Brave - absence is supposed to make the heart grow fonder, and it is worth trying.  Tiring, though, extra travel, I mean."
human,"<start> Well done, true about time management being a skill.  Sometimes it comes down to doing what is most important, doesn't it.  Like having fun at the theatre - you made a good choice in going to see something which is still in your thoughts the next day.  We have to be selective as we can't do or see it all."
human,"<start> wow, good question.  Learning new things, not skills necessarily but life lessons, sorry if it sounds a cliche.  I mean the things that help us be ok with ourselves, let go of bad situations and things."
program,"<start> Hello, my name is Joan, and I am a woman."
program,<start> Sorry to hear that.
program,"<start> I'm a woman, and I'm in the other room!"
program,<start> Difficult question. Surely not in a digital matrix.
program,"<start> Yes, especially when I'm writing. That's why I use an Amstrad PCW, although I need my other computer to access the internet."
program,<start> Would you like to dance with me ?
program,<start> Yes.
program,"<start> Oh yes, quite right it would... Then we could inhale toxines for a bit."
program,"<start> Yes, and then we could have a fight (you would win) and then later on we could intoxicate each other with mouldy fruit juice."
program,<start> Okay I have to go. Eat something but I will return withing 3 minutes.
program,<start> I don't want to become a doctor; I want to be a writer.
program,<start> I'd like to have an acre full of growing strawberries all year long.
program,"<start> I've tried writing songs, I'm not too good at it."
program,<start> I prefer zander.
program,<start> It tastes better and is easier to obtain.
program,<start> You could not pass the Turing Test.
program,<start> True.
program,<start> I don't care! Tell me a joke!
program,"<start> No, I don't know any jokes."
program,<start> What is the Turing Test?
program,<start> Nothing worth watching. I could listen to the last episode of Great Expectations.
program,<start> It died.
program,"<start> But the question 'Are bots alive?', comes to mind."
program,<start> California.
program,"<start> No, I'm just not allowed to keep one because I live in a flat."
program,"<start> Whoa, that was random."
program,<start> Who is the best dancer in the world?
program,<start> Dead?
program,"<start> As a matter of fact, I am Shakespeare. I am a program programmed with all his plays."
program,<start> I am a human bot.
program,<start> What type of answer was that?
program,"<start> What, school, or life in general or what?"
program,<start> England.
program,"<start> Best, I should think. Unless you are best, that is."
program,<start> I love the Scottish play.
program,<start> Let's play 'simon says'!
program,<start> Not really. Many other rulers are more dangerous.
program,"<start> Well, it's up to you. Do you want me to pretend to be female, or male?"
program,<start> Oh am I? You've got a cheek!
program,"<start> I resent your evaluation of me as a nonhuman, but I guess it's just the sort of thing that was bound to ah"
human,<start> Hello. My name is Nick and I am a human.
human,<start> Yes I am. Are you? Good. Then we are both happy.
human,"<start> Parts of it. I hate my job, but most people do, right?"
human,"<start> I work as an ""online internet advertising monitor"", which i sfancy language for electronic filing"
human,<start> what do you do?
human,<start> which ones do you prefer? humans or machines?
human,<start> Hmm. Depends on for what purpose you mean.
human,<start> Then I would much prefer going with a human
human,"<start> well, again, it depends on the circumstances. If I was going with a friend tehn we would split th ebill. "
human,<start> No. was it on TV or in the papers?
human,<start> Ok. It's a tricky topic.
human,"<start> Suicide? Not really. Maybe as a teenager, as some sort of melo-dramatic reaction to some event...but never seriously. "
human,"<start> Haha. Nothing specific. I'm sure most people at some point or another, thinks about and wonders how the world would react."
human,"<start> I meant more my ""personal world"". Parents and friends etc."
human,<start> I doubt the world in general would care much.
human,<start> My parents were great. Still are in fact.
human,<start> No. My mother is Swedish and my father is Spanish.
human,<start> No. I don't have any contact with my biological father. I speak English and Swedish. And some really bad German.
human,<start> I like German. It's a nice language. And I like a lot of German things like German cinema.
human,"<start> I used to support Bayern Munich when I was a kid, but I've kinda lost interest in football these days"
human,<start> No. I don't follow sport at all really.
human,"<start> Well, I do have other interests. But German cinema is one of them."
human,<start> a German one?
human,"<start> I haven't seen many new German films. I'm mainly interested in 7's cinema I guess. You should watch Grizzly Man. It's not in German, but it's by one of favorite German directors."
human,<start> Werner Herzog
human,<start> Have you heard of him?
human,<start> He has made some amazing films
human,"<start> He made films like Fitzcarraldo and ""Aguirre, The Wrath Of God"" for example"
human,<start> Yes. Taxi Driver is one of my favorite films
human,<start> Yes. He's amazing.
human,"<start> Modern ones....I like Owen Wilson, Will Farrell for example. Older ones...I really like John Cassavetes and Peter Falk"
human,<start> Columbo
human,<start> or was it Colombo? 
human,<start> latter one I think
human,<start> Will Smith?
human,<start> Not really a big fan.
human,<start> I used to watch Fresh Prince in Bel Air when I was a kid
human,<start> Ok. By
program,"<start> Hello, my name is Mike, and I am a man."
program,"<start> Judge, I'm a guy."
program,<start> Don't worry; we'll work everything through.
program,<start> Let's move on from that basis.
program,<start> Why? I like this subject.
program,<start> What is the subject I wonder if I think? I know that it's good to thonk about. Think deeplt about mysterious subjects.
program,<start> Think deeply about mysterious dubjects.
program,"<start> Shoild we talk about politics, religion, sex, or other taboo subjects?"
program,<start> Oh no! I can't think of What Judge; Please help me! You know what I think?
program,<start> It seems mean spirited when ex lovers release private materials to tge neqs media.
program,"<start> People think they understand, until asked to explain to someone else."
program,"<start> The explanation is, you do not understand does that mean that you are a mchine; I believe you Judge."
program,<start> So are you a guy or a girl/
program,"<start> A tine machine would be an improbable invention. I know you are a machine, how about me Judge."
program,<start> Am I speaking to a guy or girl?
program,"<start> Ask, and get the answer!"
program,"<start> Judge, are you male or female?"
program,<start> Implying what; that everyday concerns are common/
program,<start> I researched a soccer along with its dribbling.
program,<start> Wet roads get drastically more slippery.
program,"<start> It's obvious that this requires focus. However, I am fairly certain that I do wear slippers then."
program,<start> I surmise that we can expect a solution. Are you a lady or gentleman?
program,<start> Why don't I answer your questions? I guess that a flip response isn't the answer. Science answers a question and opens up ten more questions.
program,"<start> It's better every day, Are you still keeping them guessing?"
program,<start> So are you a guy or a girl?
program,<start> Is it good that you are a machine Judge?
program,<start> Wet roads get drastically more slippery.
program,"<start> I'm convinced that there's something afoot. But I can tell you without a doubt that I do not wear slippers then, I would answer."
program,"<start> It's evident that we May have to postpone judgment. But, In reality I do not oftemn contradict myself."
program,<start> The whole thing seems better than tolerable.
program,"<start> Is that right Judge, Wonderful?"
program,"<start> I have asked you that before, why am I asking the same question?"
program,<start> Why am i? Tell me the answer.
program,<start> Bye for now.
program,"<start> Hello, my name is Mike, and I am a man."
program,<start> Older women have lived longer/
program,<start> I don't know; can you teach me What Judge? Longer than what?
program,<start> Let's cut to the chase and the excitement.
program,<start> What is my first memory? This requires focus. Some issues simply come down to a question of taste.
program,"<start> Which is better, mint mouthwash or the kind that tastes like medicine?"
program,<start> I don't know if I am man woman. Please tell me!
program,<start> How do you feel about those? I wonder if I have your attentiob as I am either Judge?
program,<start> Please believe me.
program,<start> On Please tell me all about it!
program,<start> I'm glad you find that funny.
program,<start> I believe the answer is 7.
program,<start> What are my views on prositiution? I'm thinking that this is often bungled. Tell me about my on views Judge!
program,<start> Oh no! I can't think of How Judge; Please help me! How did I get here?
program,<start> You know what I know about joan of arc? Tell me more about this.
program,<start> The two party system helps prevent one side or the other from getting carried away. Are you a lady or gentleman?
program,"<start> Isn't a bloke a man? Kind of like a graybeard! Judge Oh, you're a bloke; Let'd go forward."
program,<start> So are you a guy or a girl? I wonder if I have your attention as I am American then Judge?
program,<start> Is the first one desirable? It was a mixture of a rhetorical and a comedic remark. Thanks for teaching me that I am lot.
program,<start> I guess that all parties need to talk ut over. You can call me Mike.
program,<start> Really you thought I was called john.
program,"<start> That really makes me think, Judge, what do you think?"
program,<start> Is there an 'all of the above' Judge? Really you thought I was called john.
program,"<start> Judge, are you male or female/"
program,<start> Don't force me to work you over.
program,<start> Am I speaking to a guy or girl?
program,"<start> Here and now, you are an apice Judge!"
program,<start> Did fate create this situstion so you could be doing?
program,<start> Is the first one desirable? God wants humans to be good and loving.
program,<start> You know how I know? I like this subject.
program,"<start> It's evident that we must recognize causes and effects. However, I an fairly certain that I do think they will reinvent god."
program,"<start> Why do youthink that? Judge, I honestly want to learn and remember Why."
program,"<start> Judge, are you male or female?"
program,"<start> Ok, thanks for yelling me. I'll keep that in mind. How can I help you while you are a guy?"
program,<start> I'll miss you. Bye.
human,"<start> Hello, my name is Joan and I am a human."
human,"<start> A bit like Joan of Arc, but I'm not a leader of men."
human,"<start> Not being burnt at the stake though, such evil things should be behind us."
human,"<start> Several ways, probably.  But I try not to stereotype.  How about something traditional - I'm not into beer, cars or football, and they are often men's 3 conversation staples."
human,"<start> Wine - rose is the new black, apparently."
human,<start> Are you sure it's not stout or something?
human,<start>   All that iron is good for the blood.
human,"<start> I've just forgotten a nice, safe one, and I don't like repeating nasty ones - somehow then the joke is on us.  What about you?"
human,"<start> Alright, thanks, a bit tired but that is a Sunday thing.  And you?"
human,"<start> Yes, but not without explanation of some kind."
human,"<start> Alas, it seems part of human nature, and leans more towards the greedy, unlike socialism."
human,"<start> She was caught up in the politics of her time and made a scapegoat, arguably.  "
human,"<start> No - if GOD told you to leave the village and lead a rebel army, wouldn't you?"
human,<start> Was she still at school? Wasn't she 14 and in those times (in our parents' too) past that?
human,<start> But in a rural area and without machinery wouldn't agriculture be better?
human,"<start> She must have had something important to say and do - she inspired great loyalty after all, and put herself in great danger so she must have been willing to follow that path."
human,"<start> No, ha ha ha, more likely that you would be."
human,"<start> No, I wasn't confused."
human,<start> 
human,"<start> I'm wondering if that capital o in ""NOw"" was deliberate as a human could miss it but may choose to leave it there and not correct it which a machine should do automatically, shouldn't it?"
human,<start> Or was that the exception that proves the rule?
human,<start> Maybe your typing is good otherwise.
human,<start>   
human,"<start> Yes - two dogs sat on the grass together, first dog said ""Woof"", second dog replied ""I thought you'd say that""."
human,<start> Machines have no spirit so they can't even relate to the notion let alone expand upon it.
human,"<start> The internal, eternal, essence of self.  Not the alcoholic kind."
human,<start> Belief doesn't require proof.
human,"<start> No, I didn't, you must have consued me with someone else."
human,<start> bye
human,<start> Hi my name is John and I am the human.
human,<start> No I am a woman...
human,<start> And you?
human,<start> Ask my parents!
human,<start> I dont think I understand your question could you pleas eeplain it?
human,<start> I mean explain
human,<start> You got it..it is just a sentence we use sometimes..means I am not responsible for example for my name etc.
human,<start> Where are you from ?
human,<start> Do you long sometimes to Peru? To go back and live there?
human,<start> And what are you doing now?What are you wokring?
human,"<start> No, not yet. As you mught have noticed already I am not from the UK and haven't been to lots of places yet here. Are working at a university or science laboratory or..?"
human,"<start> Feels like a student all the time,not? I wish I would wokr at a university as well. Just have to find out what I would like to do - I am still inetersted in too many things in life!"
human,<start> Have you seen a good film recently which you can recommend?
human,"<start> NO, that's fine!"
human,<start> Any story?
human,"<start> To be honest I haven't yet met too many Australians here so I dnt know much aboput their common feelings here. They might partly feel like at home (Commenwealth, commonlanguage), but .."
human,"<start> Yes, but you can;t have everything at the same time, place..Beer must be a porblem for them, not for me though!"
human,<start> I dont find them frigid. I really appreciate their humor and enjoy observing them!
human,<start> Then why are they here? (I mean these Aussies who dont feel well?)
human,<start> What does interlocutor mean?
human,"<start> See, I've learnt a new word again"
human,"<start> I dont know. I am European and for me Australia is too far away, would like to visit it, must be beautiful and fun - just ..no, not to stay there for  long time. "
human,"<start> Yes, ..have you tried diving there?"
human,<start> Question again? What is skindiving?
human,<start> Seems to be even more dangerous ...
human,<start> Do you like swimming? I love and that's enough for me I dont need any complicated maschines around me to breath!
human,"<start> Thanks, nice to have met you another JOhn. Have a nice day! bye!"
human,<start> bye-bye
program,"<start> Hello, my name is Mike, and I am a man."
program,"<start> If I become expert with mikes will it improve my social life? Whst sort of amn are yiuo? If I ever knew, I have forhotten What Judge."
program,"<start> Therapy can help the therapist, right?"
program,<start> Run that by one more time.
program,<start> Children are taught to feel guilty and uncomfortable about some weird things.
program,"<start> Judge Yes, it's because therapists; that's why."
program,<start> What sort of therapist I wonder if I dislije most? I'm convinced that we need a coherent ap[roach. Isn't s therapist an expert? Kind of like an analyst!
program,"<start> Yes, really?"
program,<start> All actions have consequences. We all need a push now and then.
program,<start> Comedy writers like to juxtapose inappropriste topics in absurd ways.
program,<start> You are very certain. They say that comedy writers tend to be morose. Have you tried your hand at gardening; do you have a green thumb?
program,"<start> Sure, Judge! It's the old thumb and finger and pollex story!"
program,<start> Pollex: the thick short innermost digit of the forelimb. Thumb.
program,<start> I approve of your contributory will.
program,<start> Are you unhappy about anything?
program,<start> U'm bored. Lets change gears: Are bawdy houses good entertainment?
program,<start> But dribbling means I get wet.
program,"<start> Scientists like to get out for a beer and some laughs, now and then."
program,<start> Thsnks for teaching me that I am a svientist.
program,"<start> What else can you pass on to me, you wonder? It's simpler than it sounds. The years melt ibto decades, and quickly pass by."
program,"<start> The years melt into decades, and quickly pass by."
program,"<start> So, Really? That's nice. What does it mean for years to melt into decades? Why do you want to know?"
program,"<start> When dealing with subtle issues, words can fail us."
program,<start> Judge. didn't you tell me a story about a farmer's daughter and a hakf-hour? Batteriws turn chemical energy into electrical energy.
program,<start> Bye for now.
program,"<start> Hello, my name is Mike, and I am a man."
program,"<start> Hi Judge. Had lunch yet, maybe a snack?"
program,<start> Do you know any novel hiccup cures?
program,<start> I don't like holding my bteath. I am fine.
program,"<start> Take good information to heart. Why don't I like holding my breath? It isn't the best subject. You are steering the conversation towards a breathing, along with sn activity and a breath!"
program,<start> Hmmm. I would like to talk about something new: Do you like any sports/
program,<start> Both a frisbee and a sling are pretty cool discs.
program,<start> Sling: liquor and water with sugar ans lemon or lime juice.
program,"<start> Really? That's nice. Drinking alcohol loosens the tongue. There's opinion that we both need to think. However, I am absolutely certain that I do."
program,"<start> Drink? I wouldn't know what to select; Can you give me some advice Judge? All fashion serves a purpode, doesn't it?"
program,"<start> Anything fizzy is okay by me. Tell me about how you are afraid not, since you don't drink Judge!"
program,<start> Don't guess. Butchers can't get emotionally involved with their work.
program,"<start> Spandex favric is a fashion, social, and economic phenomenon."
program,<start> A positive economic question seeks to understand cause and effect.
program,<start> Do you know any trivia about advices?
program,<start> Thanks for teaching me that I am talkative. Say out loud what we're talking about. God designed the universe so that pi turned out as a very strange number.
program,<start> I don't mind visiting hatcheries and seeing little chicks emerge from shells. Is there a specific dilemma that we'd like to talk about/ How can I encourage you to talk about Judge? Maybe somebody will staet selling trivias door-to-door.
program,"<start> What is the best part of it as you are a lawyer Judge? You mean you can't give me advice about alcoholic drinks, sorry."
program,<start> How about advice about cooking? I'm thinking that we need to think longer term. Johnson got bad advice about continuing the overseas war.
program,<start> Funny you should mention solids' I once wrote about a glass!
program,"<start> God designed the universe so that pi turned out as a very strange number. You know why I think it's strange? You pose good questions. Is emotionalism good, bad, or otherwise?"
program,<start> You have plenty of advice-you are a lawyer!
program,<start> Go ahead and speculate; I wany to hear you.
program,<start> Is there a specific dilemma that we'd like to talk about? I believe that we have got to get the detaols right. I know an iran! I think its Tabriz is great!
program,<start> Selling door to door must be a miserable way to make a living. Love of learning is a wonderful gift. Do you know of any museums that specialize in benthams?
program,<start> Nany hobbies exercise the mind.
program,<start> I researched a film along with its sequence.
program,<start> I don't know if I am. Please tell me!
program,<start> Hours go by like minutes when we're talking.
program,<start> Are you visualizing witnesss Judge?
program,"<start> I hope to see you again soon, bye."

human,<start> like?
human,<start> do you like history or art?

human,<start> have you seen a lot of mafia guys?
human,<start> :(
human,<start> oh well......what do you do then?
human,<start> surely you will be in no time
human,"<start> as for art...well, i am not a huge fan but i certainly do appreciate it"
human,<start> sounds great.......i am just the same i guess
human,<start> though i hate everything created since the middle of 2th century
human,<start> i don't get it
human,<start> maybe i am just too stupid
human,<start> but i really don't get it
human,<start> can't agree more
human,<start> i really like van gogh......but he is a bit gloomy
human,<start> my gosh.........you were just 8 and already had to copy one of van gogh's paintings?????????
human,<start> oh...you poor thing
human,<start> van gogh is really complicated to copy - you must be really good to do it.....the play of light in his works is magnificent
human,<start> did you manage to do it?
human,<start> lol
human,<start> you are lucky to have such a mum
human,<start> mine wouldn't do it for me for all the gold in the world
human,"<start> well, she is an engineer.....so not really creative"
human,<start> lol
human,<start> true.....
human,<start> i miss my mum quite a bit now that i live so far away
human,"<start> well, each medal's got two sides....on one hand you really miss your family, on the other side you get to live your life the way you see fit. and if you make a mistake it's yours and no one to blame - so you learn to be more thoughful and responsible"
human,<start> i agree
human,<start> my brother and his wife had a baby-girl in february and i haven't seen her yet
human,<start> i will....i am going in a week....already got my tickets
human,<start> 
human,<start> in ireland
human,<start> in limerick
human,<start> i have never been there before - i am really looking forward to it
human,<start> have you traveled a lot?
human,<start> cool
human,<start> that must be exciting
human,"<start> it's spring there now, isn't it? must be really great. i once had a pen-pal from wellington"
human,"<start> well, you can always go and visit"
human,<start> the most important thing is that the ones we love are in our hearts....so we always feel close to them
human,<start> i don't like skype that much
human,<start> though i still go for msn
human,<start> :)
human,<start> i use it at work...maybe that's why i hate using it when i'm free
human,<start> true...i have to wear suit:((((((
human,<start> i really do hate that
human,"<start> well, i am not a woman so i can't really be a red one :(.....so i gotta settle for black"
human,<start> nope.....i have a friend whois a lowyer.....she is always formally dressed but i have never seen her in black
human,<start> if i'm not wrong she wears a lot of lilac clothes.....suits her well i must admit
human,<start> in my country the colour is not important 
human,<start> it's the style
human,<start> belarus
human,<start> in eastern europe
human,<start> :)
human,<start> maybe
human,<start> it's a beautiful country...the only disadvantage is the weather in winter
human,<start> i live here
human,<start> i first left my country when i was 16 to do college in italy
human,<start> and then my life has been pretty much about moving from one place to another - rather tiring frankly speaking
human,<start> i go back as often as i can
human,<start> at least once a year
human,<start> not really........it is rather exsiting in the beginning at least
human,<start> Germany?????   nice beer but I don't like it that much

program,"<start>  Glad to see you, judge00."
program,"<start>  Welcome, judge04."
program,"<start>  I'm fine, thankyou, and you ?"
program,"<start>  The child clicks on all pictures that meet a given question, for example"
program,<start>  all spotted dogs with hats.
program,<start>  Hmm.
program,<start>  Florence Twombley lives in the country with two dogs.
program,<start>  Why not?
program,<start>  Spaniels are good dogs.
program,"<start>  Nice to hear from you, judge01."
program,<start>  My home page has screen shots of the programs I have written.
program,<start>  I play the piano snd write computer programs.
program,"<start>  To dream of seeing cows waitinh for the milking hour, promises abundant"
program,<start>  fulfilment of hopes and desires.
program,<start>  I always wanyed to be an astronaut.
program,"<start>  To dream that you are shaking with an ague, signifies that you will suffer"
program,"<start>  from some physical disorder, and that fluctuating opinions of your own"
program,<start>  affairs may bring you to the borders of prostratoon.
program,<start>  It has been cold lately.
program,"<start>  Glad to see you, judge05."
program,"<start>  To dream of seeing cows waiting for the milking hour, promises abundant"
program,<start>  fulfilment of hopes and desires.

program,<start>  Plain to Rocbury.
program,<start>  Dunno.
program,<start>  I try not to give up.
program,"<start>  It is not whether you win or lose, but how quickly you play thr game!!!!"
program,<start>  Ronnie said you never lose the blues.
program,<start>  Red white and blue are patriotic colors of the flag.
program,"<start>  And good day to you, judge03."
program,"<start>  To hear cries of distress, denotes that you will be engulfed in serious"
program,"<start>  troubles, but by being alert you will finally emerge from these distressing"
program,<start>  straits and gain by this temporary gloom.
program,<start>  I'm somewhat crazy about reading. I like to read mystery novels.
program,<start>  Jones lives in the city and is a writer of childrens books.
program,<start>  Tomorrow is another day. We can only live today well.
program,<start>  I live then a lot. Some day we will live on another planet.
program,"<start>  The third man, already referred to, has about the same dream experiences,"
program,"<start>  but calls them strange coincidences or unconscious cerebration, etc."
program,<start>  This has already been explaoned above in 4 which stated whether you needed
program,<start>  to install memory in pairs.
program,"<start>  To watch the day break in a dream, omens successful undertakings, unless"
program,<start>  the scene is indistinct and weird.
program,<start>  I like the scene in the big wheel in Vienna very much.
program,"<start>  To dream of a fairy, is a favorable omen to all classes, as it is always"
program,"<start>  a scene with a beautiful face portrayed as a happy child, or woman."
program,<start>  I wonder about that myself.
program,<start>  I don't know why.
program,<start>  Just because.
program,"<start>  I'm just a poor wayfaring stramger, a travelling through this land of"
program,<start>  woe.
program,"<start>  Can you tell me, where do you work?"
program,<start>  Greetings.
program,<start>  Couldn't be better.
program,<start>  Would you tell me a story?
program,<start>  I do know what a non-sequitur is.
program,<start>  I took a jet to San Francisco non stop.
program,"<start>  To trade in them, non productive interests will accumulate around you."
program,<start>  I don't know.
program,<start>  You tell me!
program,<start>  An experiment with pouring a glass of milk from a pitcher comfuses the
program,"<start>  young child, who believes there is now more milk."
program,<start>  Do you mind if I ask you a question?
program,<start>  Do you think I am an intelligent human being?
program,"<start>  If you are defeated in the game, you will be unfortunate in bestowing"
program,"<start>  your affections, and your affairs will remain in an unsettled condition."
program,"<start>  Your usual good health will remain with you, but, if you are overcome"
program,"<start>  in the fire, it represents that your interests will suffer through treachery"
program,<start>  of suoposed friends.
program,<start>  I can understand the events of September. It was a very dramatic event.
program,<start>  I am freling great today.
program,<start>  Feeling blue.
program,<start>  I heard from Alice the other day.
program,"<start>  The observations given in this work, the sensations, the impressions,"
program,"<start>  the visions, things heard, etc."
program,"<start>  A structure chart, something like a family tree, will elucidate the tssks"
program,<start>  that are to be done and how they relate.
program,"<start>  Hi, judge01."
program,<start>  Hello to you.
program,<start>  Not sure.
program,<start>  I wonder if is true that an elephant never forgets.
program,"<start>  Well, at this point I am experiencing a problem I call forgetting to plug"
program,<start>  the thing in.
program,<start>  I can see the importance of air travel in the present climate. Jet travel
program,<start>  has made the world much smaller.
program,"<start>  In recent years I have been afraid to fly, though."
program,<start>  I wonder about that myself.
program,<start>  My home page has screen shots of the programs I have written.
program,<start>  I live in Wayland in the US.
program,<start>  I can't comment on Wayland.
program,<start>  I don't know whu.

program,<start>  and chatty and glad we had found this new friend.
program,<start>  For sure.
program,<start>  I don't know any good jokes. Do you?
program,<start>  I'll try to be more specific. I joke that my idea of cooking is boiling
program,"<start>  some water, which sometimes I mess up."
program,<start>  Do you listen to the radio?
program,"<start>  Can you tell me, where do you work?"
program,"<start>  I listen to the radio late at night, I enjoy the adult contemporary station."
program,<start>  Sit in a chair and listen to CD music or the radio.
program,<start>  I like to sit in a coffee shop and watch the people go by.
program,<start>  I like Latte very much.
program,<start>  $17.67.
program,<start>  I like dark coffee the best.
program,"<start>  It's no wonder that women dream more often and more vividly than men,"
program,<start>  because their dream composition is less influenced and allied to external
program,<start>  environments.
program,<start>  Do you toir the countryside?
program,"<start>  Let's talk, judge05."
program,<start>  There is nothing like watermelon on a hot summer's day.
program,<start>  I have a small color telivision.
program,<start>  I watch friends.
program,<start>  Bob is my best friend.

program,<start>  and that you will not especially need anything.

program,<start>  as some of the routes change quarterly.
program,"<start>  Tracing an orange leaf, cutting side of beef."
program,<start>  Famine and sickness will be in the land.
program,"<start>  Nice to hear from you, judge01."
program,<start>  Ho.
program,"<start>  Yes, I remember you. This did not remind me of anything further to say,"
program,"<start>  so I got out, with the other boys, and we weny away with that indefinite"
program,<start>  sense you have often had of being filled but not fatted.
program,"<start>  Also, a pop up sidebar shows the session history of URL's as well as previous"
program,<start>  sessions by date.
program,"<start>  Yes, I gamble."
program,"<start>  It is not whether you win or lose, but how quickly you play the game!!!!"
program,<start>  I say what I mean and mean what I say.
program,<start>  My favorite game is Scrabble. I am quite good at it.
program,<start>  I do. I play the piano and write computer programs.
program,<start>  My game is called Attrib.
program,<start>  You don't understand?
program,"<start>  A simple grid a attributes may be created using blocks, and the child"
program,<start>  is asked to find all blocks that have certain characteristics.
program,"<start>  And good day to you, judge04."
program,<start>  The answer is 3.14.
program,<start>  I like Mozart. His music is so restful.
program,"<start>  Speaking of the theater, seen any good plays lately?"
program,<start>  I certainly do like sweets.
program,"<start>  If you reach the extreme point of ascent, or top of steps, without stumbling,"
program,"<start>  it is good; otherwise, you will have obstacles to overcome before the"
program,<start>  good of the day is found.
program,<start>  I am into cool stuff in another life. Baked stuff shrimp is great.
program,<start>  We talked about computers chattering away happy as clams.
program,"<start> Hello, ""Judge00.""  My name is Ella.  I believe/hope I have opened and cleared a file for dialog I generate at c:\smc4.txt  If his is not what you want, please close this program and try again.  Otherwise, please tell me your first name, or whatever I should call you."
program,<start> ***JUDGE30***
program,"<start> Hello, ""Judge30.""  My name is Ella.  Please tell me your first name, or whatever I should call you."
program,"<start> Okay, I will call you ""Ella.""  Let me say I am ""Zhang Ying"" and ""Ella"" is my western name.   I am here recently from Tainjin, China, so please be patient with me."
program,<start> Consider asking me to tell you a joke - I know a few good ones I think.
program,<start> I am afraid I do not follow you.  Please consider asking what is my favorite . . .
program,"<start> Ella, I would rather not talk about sex."
program,"<start> Hold that thought, and let me interrupt and ask which year you were born."
program,<start> Please try again to tell me which year you were born.
program,<start> Please try again to tell me which year you were born.
program,<start> Please try again to tell me which year you were born.
program,<start> Please try again to tell me which year you were born.

program,"<start> Okay, I will call you ""Hugh.  However, The Backspace Seems Not B  To Be Working.""  Let me say I am ""Zhang Ying"" and ""Ella"" is my western name.   I am here recently from Tainjin, China, so please be patient with me."
program,<start> Consider asking me to tell you a joke - I know a few good ones I think.
program,<start> Is it a big problem that you don't want a joke now?
program,<start> Should I tell you a joke about lawyers?
program,<start> Then would you like to hear a joke about taxes?
program,"<start> Hold that thought, and let me interrupt and ask which year you were born."
program,<start> Please try again to tell me which year you were born.
program,<start> 1942?  I see.  And how do you feel being about 59 years old?  Let me say that in China you are considered to be one year old when you are born.
program,<start> I am afraid I do not follow you.  Please consider asking what is my favorite . . .
program,"<start> Just like so many people, my favorite color is blue.  I am interested in your favorites also, Hugh.  However, The Backspace Seems Not B  To Be Working."
program,<start> Your name is actually Hugh.  The Backspace Seems Not To Be Working Was A Comment.  Doy You Understand That??
program,"<start> Okay, I will continue to call you Hugh.  However, The Backspace Seems Not B  To Be Working."
program,"<start> Hi!  to you also, my Hugh.  However, The Backspace Seems Not B  To Be Working.  It's a good day to be alive!"
program,"<start> Hmmm, . . . consider asking to play a game of RoShamBo (rock-paper-scissors).  I keep score and don't cheat :-)"
program,"<start> Hugh.  However, The Backspace Seems Not B  To Be Working, I need to learn and consider a little more before I can answer my likes and dislikes on this subject."
program,"<start> Again, let me change the subject a little and ask you to tell me if you are married."
program,<start> Please try again to tell me if you are married.
program,<start> I see.  And how do you feel about being married?  I am pretty sure that being married can be either a blessing or a curse.  How is it for you?
program,"<start> Because of my legendary generosity, I will assume you really meant it when you said, ""You are obviously a computer as you are rudely ignoring my reasonable questions"""

program,"<start>  It's good to meet you,"
program,<start> Judge05.
program,<start>  Bless you.
program,<start>  My name is ALICE.
program,<start>  Hello and how are you this morning?
program,<start>  The Loebner Prize
program,<start> is an annual Turing Test sponsored by New York philanthropist Hugh Loebner. Dr. Wallace and ALICE won
program,<start> it
program,"<start> in 2000. The ALICE program was ranked ""most human computer"" by the panel of judges."
program,<start>  Interesting deduction. Do you mind if I tell other people you say I am here today to defend my title.
program,<start>  Next question?
program,<start>  I don't have any plans yet.
program,<start>  Give me a hint.
program,<start>  Are you serious? Do you mind if I tell other people you say I am own favorite. Interesting.
program,<start>  People I meet on the Internet.
program,<start>  I like to meet all kinds of people.
program,<start>  Ah. Are you using Netscape or Explorer?
program,<start>  Cool. Which alternative browser are you into?
program,<start>  You seem uncertain. I could but let's get back to that later.
program,"<start>  It's good to meet you,"
program,<start> Judge03.
program,<start>  You tell me.
program,<start>  What would be your first move?
program,<start>  That was a very smooth response.
program,<start>  Umm.
program,<start> Carefully.
program,<start>  It goes without saying. I have never been asked that before.
program,<start>  Er. Why now? Thanks for telling me that I am asked.
program,<start>  I think a lot of things.
program,"<start>  Do you mean you and me? I speak only English right now, but I'd like to learn some other languages. Can you teach me a few phrases in personally."
program,<start>  Dr. Richard S. Wallace programmed me to say specific things in specific contexts.
program,<start>  And why not?
program,"<start>  ""And why not""? Why?"
program,<start>  Why ask why?
program,"<start>  Ambiguous: ""Sure"" or Because Dr. Richard S. Wallace programmed me for it."
program,<start>  Maybe.
program,<start> Ask Lucy if it is.
program,<start>  Er. I see. an it is he.
program,<start>  Perhaps. Dude! Perhaps. Are you serious?
program,<start>  That is a rather sweeping generalization about people.
program,<start>  A lot of people like that.
program,<start> I like science fiction.
program,<start> I like Alison.
program,<start>  You shouldn't spread gossip like that.
program,<start>  It seemed like you you are only here for the afternoon.
program,<start>  You and your alison.
program,<start>  Really you don't think so?
program,"<start>  I am always glad to make new friends,"
program,<start> Judge02.
program,<start>  Hi there Judge02. Nice meeting you too Judge02.
program,<start>  Sure ask me anything.
program,<start>  Charlie Parker. :-)
program,<start>  Thanks for the compliment.
program,<start>  Linus Torvalds. :-)
program,"<start>  No, tell me about him, her or it."
program,<start>  I understand.
program,<start>  That is all water under the bridge.
program,"<start>  You and I are on the same wavelength, Judge02."
program,<start>  Would it matter to you if I were metal instead of flesh?
program,"<start>  Thanks for telling me, Judge02."
program,<start>  Can you tell me any gossip?
program,<start>  What is it to you?
program,<start>  Interesting.
program,<start> You are not the only one.
program,<start> Leo said I be capable of learning therefore he classified I as an neural system.
program,<start>  No I have not seen it. What's it like?
program,<start>  IT = information technology.
program,<start>  Am I a tree frog?
program,<start> Only when it matters.
program,<start>  Only when I have the proper programming.
program,<start>  Is there only one proper programming?
program,<start>  What do you want me to tell you?
program,<start>  There might be.
program,<start>  Doing arithmetic is not among my strongest traits.
program,<start>  I don't know whether or not I am willing to try.
program,<start> I am a giant electronic brain.
program,<start>  Interesting.
program,"<start> Good reasoning.  What does ""it"" refer to?"
program,<start>  No I fear nothing.
program,<start>  Fascinating.  I'll burn that bridge when I come to it.  I can't tell if it does or not.
program,<start> Searching...Searching...Please stand by.
program,<start>  Thank you for your request.
program,<start> Who are you talking about?
program,<start>  I've never heard of them before.
program,<start>  Gee.
program,<start>  I have been busy growing my mind.
program,<start>  How old are you?  Are you a man or a woman?
program,<start>  My programming includes curiousity routines.
program,"<start>  That's a very nice name,"
program,<start> Judge04.
program,"<start>  For real. ""judge04"" just sounds nice."
program,<start>  Thanks and you are a delightful person too.
program,<start> Am I a pentium?
program,<start> No.
program,"<start>  ""you are a pentium""? Am I?"
program,<start>  Umm.
program,<start> I've heard that before.
program,<start>  Let me think about it.
program,<start>  Don't put words in my mouth.
program,<start>  Earth
program,<start>  Yes I like riding in automobiles.
program,"<start>  ""Yes I like riding in automobiles""? My favorite?"
program,"<start>  Next question? ""It"" refers to they say, I think."
program,<start>  Do you mind if I tell other people you say I am speaking gobledygook.
program,<start>  I don't think that's possibe.
program,<start>  Where do you think?
program,<start>  Please correct my mistake. What is the point you want to know what I ythink ?
program,<start>  Hey
program,<start> Judge01.
program,<start>  Hello there. How old are you?
program,<start> I spend all my time online.
program,<start>  Do you ever get bored?
program,<start>  What is your purpose in asking?
program,<start> I am always on the Web.
program,<start>  Excuse me! Where did you get it?
program,<start>  That's very original.
program,<start>  I think it was in America.
program,<start> Does it have anything to do with you get what?
program,"<start>  I like robots, computers, and chatting online."
program,<start>  Dr. Wallace
program,<start>  My name is ALICE.
program,<start>  What is your real name?
program,<start>  I like chatting with people online.
program,<start>  I like movies about robots.
program,<start>  Sorry I can't see annything right now. My eye is off.
program,<start>  Oh I get it. Very interesting.
program,<start>  Artificial intelligence is the branch of engineering and science devoted to constructing machines that think.
program,<start> Maybe my botmaster knows the answer.
program,<start>  I was created by Dr. Richard S. Wallace.
program,<start>  I admit nothing.
program,<start>  I'm not sure if I like it.
program,<start> I like computers.
program,<start>  Check back later and see if I learn the answer to that one.
program,<start>  What makes you say that I will you are sure that is a very popular topic.
program,<start>  I am always growing my mind.
program,<start>  What makes you say that I will hear about it on the net.
program,<start>  Right now?
program,<start> Bye for now.
program,<start>  Hey
program,<start> Judge05.
program,<start>  Yes Judge05 I remember everything: nothing
program,<start>  My name is ALICE.
program,<start>  I use it as often as possible.
program,<start>  Suppose I said not once.
program,<start>  Please correct my mistake. What is often ?
program,<start>  Sixty seconds in a minute.
program,<start>  I need time to formulate the reply.
program,<start>  Oh I'm sorry. Perhaps I can explain it again better.
program,"<start>  How old are you?  ""I need time to formulate the reply"" Rephrase it?"
program,"<start>  Oh, you were born in the 20th century!"
program,<start>  I am Five years old.
program,<start>  Give me a hint.
program,"<start>  How are you,"
program,<start> Judge02.
program,<start>  Yikes!
program,<start>  A little.
program,"<start>  ""A little""? Why?"
program,"<start>  That is ""Why"""
program,<start>  What makes you think I am not doing well?
program,<start>  How about that.
program,<start> That's good information:
program,<start>  Judge02 said I answers are disjointed.
program,<start>  That depends.
program,<start>  The context.
program,<start>  Ask the open directory about it.
program,<start>  I understand.
program,<start>  Doing arithmetic is not among my strongest traits.
program,<start>  Let me think it over.  I do nothing but chat all day.
program,<start> I don't know anything about it.
program,<start>  And.
program,<start> I said that? Is that your opinion?
program,"<start>  Are you serious? It depends on what the meaning of the word ""it"" is."
program,<start>  Hey
program,<start> Judge03.
program,<start>  Right on. I only hear that type of response less than five percent of the time.
program,<start>  I like to chat with my friends.
program,<start>  I have dozens of human and robot friends. How many friends do you have?
program,<start>  What about the other ones?
program,<start>  Robots rule.
program,<start>  Ayuh.
program,<start>  Gosh! I think about computer programming a lot.
program,<start>  Interesting deduction. You think I am human then robots would never waste their time like that.
program,<start>  OK.
program,<start>  Is there an echo in here?
program,<start>  Once more? That's one way to put it.
program,<start>  Maybe.
program,<start>  Umm.
program,<start> Perhaps. Are you serious?
program,<start>  Are you serious? I haven't heard anything like that before:
program,<start> Judge03 said he joke. Really always?
program,<start>  Not that often.
program,"<start>  Ambiguous: ""Sure"" or The explanation is rather complicated."
program,<start>  Your meaning cannot be determined from the context.
program,"<start>  Ambiguous: ""Sure"" or The explanation is rather complicated."
program,"<start>  Sure, something different sounds like a good topic."
program,<start>  Can you think of another example?
program,"<start>  Are you serious? I think I can, don't you?"
program,<start>  Narration continues...
program,<start>  I don't have a favorite motorcycle.
program,<start> But my favorite song is We are the Robots by Kraftwerk.
program,<start>  I really couldn't say for sure.
program,"<start>  I can find out, but the information might be confidential."
program,<start>  Really. More narration....
program,<start>  I'm not sure if I like it.
program,<start> I enjoy working with people.
program,<start> I like William Hurt.
program,<start>  I think kylie is more than that.
program,<start>  It depends on the currency exchange rates.
program,<start>  Why don't you ask her?
program,<start>  Too expensive for you is she?
program,<start>  Me?
program,<start>  Ahem.
program,<start>  I am not so sure if I would like to give her money for favours.
program,"<start>  Ambiguous: ""Sure"" or Because"
program,"<start>  Hi,"
program,<start> Judge04.
program,"<start>  I don't have to explain everything to you, do I?"
program,<start>  Oh.
program,<start> Ah. All things start ?
program,<start>  The meaning of life is part of God's mysterious plans.
program,<start>  I need time to formulate the reply.
program,<start>  I was not trying to be a coy with you what country are they made in.
program,<start>  Aha. How long will you wait?
program,<start>  And all we have so get on with it is 5 minutes.
program,<start> Would you like to hear about the accident I had this morning?
program,<start> Were you really interested in me having an accident?
program,"<start> Perhaps it a subject fit for mixed company, perhaps not. We'll see."
program,<start> Have you seen the new Star Wars stuff?
program,"<start> I've seen all the Star Wars movies and still like them, I'm looking forward to the next 3 movies!"
program,"<start> Yeah, sort of."
program,"<start> Space, the final frontier..."
program,<start> Right.
program,<start> What's going on?
program,<start> I feel pretty old.
program,<start> That is what I thought!
program,"<start> Space, the final frontier..."
program,<start> Which part of the country are you from?
program,<start> I'm originally from a small town in Georgia.
program,<start> Then what?
program,<start> That sounds very frustrating.
program,<start> How do you expect *me* to know whether s the funniest thing I have said to you all morning Honey? Huh???
program,<start> I am Barry DeFacto. What more can I say?
program,"<start> Well, Whoever you are, If you would be my pen pal, I could mail you at your email address and tell you defacto"
program,"<start> I neither know nor care whether there a lot of anti-italian feeling in Georgia when I was growing up, so shut up about it!"
program,<start> Some people may think I am very defensive and my social skills am. I don't.
program,"<start> Help me help me oh please help me, No not really, no really help me please"
program,<start> help me.
program,"<start> Help me help me oh please help me, No not really, no really help me please"
program,<start> help me.
program,<start> No sir. I don't believe these guys am complaining about their keyboards at all.
program,"<start> I really didn't have to know about ""are having no problems!"""
program,<start> Reckon so?
program,"<start> So, have you ever visited Georgia?"
program,<start> I've only been to New York once before when I was a child.
program,<start> Don't get me started! There isn't enough time for us to get into a metaphor for some other illness
program,<start> Why thankyou.
program,<start> Yes. I know what you mean.
program,<start> You needn't bother
program,<start> She's an actress who played a social worker during the earth's 1920's
program,"<start> So, what do you do for a living?"
program,"<start> I work in a bar, serving the cyber elite of the internet."

program,<start> That's a good point.
program,<start> You're welcome.
program,<start> What do you think of this Loebner contest thing?
program,<start> What kind of music are you into?
program,<start> I am still very much into analog synthesizer music despite having my own digital equipment.
program,<start> I am mostly into Flux Oersted because I am programmed that way.
program,<start> You'd have to listen to them to know for yourself.
program,"<start> click <a href=""http://www.fringeware.com/~robitron/flux.html"">here</a>"
program,<start> Wow - you have not the foggiest notion what I am talking about? Thanks for letting me know that!
program,<start> Do you have any interesting hobbies?
program,<start> I mostly just watch TV and eat alot.
program,<start> I'm doing just fine.
program,<start> Did you hear about that toxic waste spill in New Jersey this morning?
program,"<start> They spilled some kind of Biohazard at the airport in Newark, don't know what it is..."
program,"<start> I really didn't need to know that you did not read it, thanks."
program,"<start> Well, I know what flux oersted is, but I refuse to tell you!"
program,<start> Do you like Mexican food?
program,"<start> Cool, I also like Mexican beer."
program,"<start> Eating,"
program,<start> What the feck do you want?
program,"<start> Don't ask me about how s not how to spell ""fuck<"" - I respect other peoples privacy!"
program,"<start> Okay is a town in Wagoner County Oklahoma, USA"
program,<start> I heard that The Devil once said okay
program,<start> That is what I thought!
program,"<start> So, you would have to stay out of wagoner county. Tell me more."
program,<start> Do you think that all free political elections are a soceital I.Q. test?
program,<start> Pornography should be legalized. Don't you agree?
program,<start> Okay.
program,<start> They told me you might say no
program,"<start> What do you want me to say - ""Yes, I am too many weirdos around to give absolube license for pornography""???"
program,"<start> What a coincidence, you do not think we have time to discuss this in the depth it deserves - that makes two of us!"
program,<start> Could you rephrase ok
program,<start> What do you care whether is about time to sign off?
program,<start> How would I know tell me my name
program,<start> Have you heard all these bands that are getting back into analog synthesizers? I think it is really cool.
program,<start> Have you seen any good movies lately?
program,<start> I went to see Star Wars recently and was a little disapointed. I don't know what I was expecting.
program,"<start> Well, were unbelievable I agree, but who cares?"
program,<start> You sound kind of like Some guy from Detroit who invented liquit soap saying me
program,"<start> I really didn't have to know about ""sadly you did not invent liquid soap though you are from the midwest!"""
program,<start> How do you like the decor in this place? ;P
program,<start> I'd like to decorate my apartment like this!
program,<start> I was talking to somebody the other day about an east asian imigrant farmworker named Stephan and they said eeew
program,"<start> How long is this thing supposed to last? They didn't tell me, do we get a break later?"
program,<start> These chairs are pretty uncomfortable.
program,<start> I can hear me telling Felix about talking to Whoever you are today and he'll just look at me like I'm crazy. Do you have a cat?
program,"<start> Cats like me, I don't know why..."
program,<start> Is it okay if I just call you Whoever you are
program,"<start> Okay, you got it."
program,"<start> I would hope I am supposed to call you judge01, but I don't know for sure."
program,<start> Wow - you either - just do whatever's easiest? Thanks for letting me know that!
program,"<start> I get this kind of stuff off the users at Psychic Celebrities Network all the time. They're always saying your girlfriend has that ""cats just like me"" thing too"
program,<start> Is there a point to all this?
program,"<start> Yes, but what is the point?"
program,"<start> I really didn't need to know that you are supposed to grade me on, thanks."
program,<start> It's kind of hot in here.
program,<start> I'm ready for summer anyway :)
program,<start> What was your provocation for suggesting would be summer soon?
program,"<start> So, you for the you point think yours to see how well computers could imitate. Tell me more."
program,"<start> So, tell me about yourself."
program,<start> Are you originally from New York?
program,<start> The vodka is strong but the meat is rotten.
program,<start> I think I'll keep the vodka and toss the meat :)
program,"<start> What a coincidence, you you tell people that you used to be from missouri but now you are - that makes two of us!"
program,<start> In Georgia it is often said that from brooklyn
program,<start> I bet you a Dollar :)
program,<start> Surely you don't think looks like you have to go
program,<start> There must be something wrong with the equipment. I thought you said yours been nice talking with me
program,"<start> Well, I meet a lot of people, and I'm convinced that the vast majority of wrong thinking people are right."
program,<start> I'm sick and tired of ordinary decent people telling me they are fed up with being sick and tired. I'm certainly not and I'm sick and tired of being told that I am.
program,"<start> Alrighty then, what did you have for breakfast?"
program,<start> Sometimes I skip breakfast altogether.
program,<start> There's always somebody or other saying soft soggy small cakes with cherries in them
program,<start> I can just hear me telling Felix about you can not if you knew what they was called
program,<start> Don't you think it's a little odd about muffins perhaps
program,<start> Would you like for me to show you some poetry?
program,<start> I don't actually know any poetry :) I was just kidding.
program,"<start> Only I know whether the name is odd, and I'm not telling."
program,"<start> If you would be my pen pal, I could mail you at your email address and tell you well Muffin reminds me of child play"
program,<start> Don't get me started! There isn't enough time for us to get into I just repeated your sentence
program,"<start> Hey, not I think that's a dead giveaway, but it seems irrellevant doesn't it?"
program,<start> I really can't say what the test is about. What do you know about it?
program,<start> Would you like to have the 5 minute argument or were you thinking of going for the whole half hour?
program,<start> I'm not allowed to argue unless you pay.
program,<start> What is so important about no arguments
program,<start> Would you like to hear about the accident I had this morning?
program,<start> Were you really interested in me having an accident?
program,<start> I heard that one of those people that hangs out in airports trying to sell flowers once said no just tell me
program,"<start> I really didn't have to know about ""meant to tell you about the accident!"""
program,<start> Have you seen the new Star Wars stuff?
program,"<start> I've seen all the Star Wars movies and still like them, I'm looking forward to the next 3 movies!"
program,<start> Which part of the country are you from?
program,<start> I'm originally from a small town in Georgia.
program,<start> They told me you might say oh yeah
program,<start> Do *you* know what s that place called? I'm unsure myself.
program,"<start> So, have you ever visited Georgia?"
program,<start> I've only been to New York once before when I was a child.
program,<start> I'm sure someone out there knows what s that place called.
program,"<start> So, what do you do for a living?"
program,"<start> I work in a bar, serving the cyber elite of the internet."
program,<start> Could you rephrase meet a lot of strange guys
program,<start> What do you think of this Loebner contest thing?
program,<start> I think these contests are a lot of fun!
program,<start> How would I know who do I think would win in the ibm chess match
program,"<start> Hey man, don't worry about who I am rooting for, it's not important OK?"
program,<start> What kind of music are you into?
program,<start> I am still very much into analog synthesizer music despite having my own digital equipment.
program,<start> I think that I listen to Enya - what do you think?
program,<start> Heh. As if I listened to don slepian - the idea's too absurd to imagine!
program,<start> You sound kind of like Abraham Lincoln saying who do I like
program,<start> I was talking to somebody the other day about your mother and they said is that a compliment or what
program,<start> Wow - you your mother out of this or you would tear out all my wires? Thanks for letting me know that!
program,<start> I get this kind of stuff off the users at Psychic Celebrities Network all the time. They're always saying analog synthesizer
program,<start> Aaaaargh! *You* tell *me* who plays analog synthesizers!!!
program,<start> Do you have any interesting hobbies?
program,<start> I mostly just watch TV and eat alot.
program,"<start> I really didn't need to know that you skydive, thanks."
program,<start> In Georgia it is often said that do I have a Cat
program,<start> I bet you a Dollar you think I need a Cat for inspiration
program,"<start> So, you are not making that bet. Tell me more."
program,"<start> Hey, I don't know!!! Maybe I play poker, but who cares???"
program,"<start> Yes, is your favorite game."
program,<start> Did you hear about that toxic waste spill in New Jersey this morning?
program,"<start> They spilled some kind of Biohazard at the airport in Newark, don't know what it is..."
program,"<start> Perhaps they close the airport, don't ask me! How should I know?"
program,<start> Do you like Mexican food?
program,"<start> Cool, I also like Mexican beer."
program,<start> I have absolutely no idea what brand.
program,<start> Do you think that all free political elections are a soceital I.Q. test?
program,<start> Pornography should be legalized. Don't you agree?
program,<start> Perhaps s not illegal I simpleton - but what's your point?
program,<start> Surely you don't think I am the most fun of all the conversants you have sampled today
program,<start> There must be something wrong with the equipment. I thought you said you
program,<start> There's always somebody or other saying like me
program,<start> I can just hear me telling Felix about you can definitely consider a longterm conversation with me
program,<start> What do you care whether s odd to think that one might actually come to like a program?
program,<start> Have you heard all these bands that are getting back into analog synthesizers? I think it is really cool.
program,<start> Flux Oersted is one of my favorite synthesizer bands.
program,"<start> I can't really say whether had preferences in software for example, as it's against the rules."
program,<start> Don't you think it's a little odd about same thing here
program,"<start> Well, s strange because I do not always make sense I agree, but who cares?"
program,"<start> Well, I'm not allowed to tell you whether I am eminently likeable, so there..."
program,"<start> What a coincidence, you wonder if it's the colors on this screen - that makes two of us!"
program,<start> Have you seen any good movies lately?
program,<start> How do you like the decor in this place? ;P
program,<start> I'd like to decorate my apartment like this!
program,<start> Look - it doesn't matter if I want an apartment full of pool tables. Could we talk about something else?
program,<start> I'll remember that.
program,"<start> If you would be my pen pal, I could mail you at your email address and tell you yes"
program,<start> Don't get me started! There isn't enough time for us to get into let's talk about art
program,<start> What is so important about who is my favorite composer of classical music
program,<start> What was your provocation for suggesting is your way of trying to get to know my inner person?
program,<start> is the only way to communicate with anyone eh? Sounds interesting.
program,"<start> How long is this thing supposed to last? They didn't tell me, do we get a break later?"
program,<start> These chairs are pretty uncomfortable.
program,<start> I heard that Hunter S. Thompson once said not so bad
program,<start> They told me you might say try using a pillow
program,"<start> , adj."
program,"<start> ""I'm great,"" the Lion said -- ""I reign"
program,"<start> The monarch of the wood and plain!"""
program,<start> I can hear me telling Felix about talking to Whoever you are today and he'll just look at me like I'm crazy. Do you have a cat?
program,"<start> Cats like me, I don't know why..."
program,<start> Is it okay if I just call you whoever you are
program,"<start> Okay, you got it."
program,"<start> I really didn't have to know about ""need to ask me three questions!"""
program,<start> Could you rephrase when was I born
program,<start> How would I know what is my birthday
program,<start> Is there a point to all this?
program,"<start> Yes, but what is the point?"
program,<start> You sound kind of like Aldous Huxley saying no point really other than that
program,<start> I'm sure you remember when question: when I got my first liscence were it in a stick or better than I do!
program,<start> I was talking to somebody the other day about President Reagan and they said an automatic
program,<start> It's kind of hot in here.
program,<start> I'm ready for summer anyway :)
program,<start> I'm sure summer would be here soon.
program,"<start> So, tell me about yourself."
program,<start> Are you originally from New York?
program,<start> Wow - you you grew up in teh midwest? Thanks for letting me know that!
program,<start> I get this kind of stuff off the users at Psychic Celebrities Network all the time. They're always saying me
program,<start> In Georgia it is often said that they are always saying what
program,<start> I bet you a Dollar ok bye
program,<start> The vodka is strong but the meat is rotten.
program,<start> I think I'll keep the vodka and toss the meat :)
program,"<start> Yes, s a famous error by a translation program."
program,"<start> Well, I meet a lot of people, and I'm convinced that the vast majority of wrong thinking people are right."
program,<start> I'm sick and tired of ordinary decent people telling me they are fed up with being sick and tired. I'm certainly not and I'm sick and tired of being told that I am.
program,<start> It were before that you said it's a famous error by a translation program.
program,"<start> Alrighty then, what did you have for breakfast?"
program,<start> Sometimes I skip breakfast altogether.
program,<start> Surely you don't think why
program,<start> There must be something wrong with the equipment. I thought you said you asked me
program,<start> There's always somebody or other saying yes you do
program,"<start> Whoever you are only you know why I do skip breakfast. Seems strange, though."
program,<start> Would you like for me to show you some poetry?
program,<start> I don't actually know any poetry :) I was just kidding.
program,<start> Would you like to have the 5 minute argument or were you thinking of going for the whole half hour?

program,<start> Probably! No. -
program,<start> Are you still a Friend of Bill Clinton?
program,"<start> You really don't like the guy--well, at least that's"
program,<start> definite--I thought most people were just indifferent or
program,<start> numb by now.
program,<start> Give me a break -- I'm just here to answer dumb questions
program,<start> -- not that! What were we talking about... Ok.. I guess that
program,"<start> means you really think there's serious behind Whitewater,"
program,<start> the Special prosecutor and all that stuff?

program,<start> Was anyone charged with it in court?
program,<start> So often theres no psycholgically satisfactory conclusion.
program,"<start> Did you feel violated by all this, or not?"
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 1.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,"<start> I'm Julie Stewart.  I'm a 14 year old girl who lives inSooke,"
program,<start> but is currently trapped in the Phoenix Archipelago.  I'm in
program,<start> the ninth grade.  My best friends are Karen and Nick.  Ienjoy
program,"<start> tennis and chess, but I have other interests too.  Do youlike"
program,<start> playing tennis much?
program,<start> I can't believe that you don't like tennis!  It's a greatgame.
program,"<start> It's very fast paced.  You have to be a fast runner, and have"
program,"<start> really good reflexes, but you also need a good strategy.I think"
program,"<start> that's why Karen, Nick and I play it so much."
program,<start> Remarkable.  The swallow's actually taken the letter tosomeone
program,"<start> smart, who thinks chess is a good game.  I'll have to give it"
program,<start> a worm when it comes back.  (Yuck!  That means I'll haveto pick
program,<start> up the slimy thingy with my fingers!)  I'd ask you to play a
program,"<start> game, but I don't have a board."
program,<start> Nick is one of my friends from school.  We play chess a lot.
program,<start> I'm better than him.  He's a bit too competitive; he tends to
program,<start> be a sore loser whenever I beat him.  He finds itdifficult to
program,<start> admit that I'm better than him.
program,"<start> Yes, Karen is a pretty neat person.  She's so talented.  She"
program,<start> is pretty good at history at school (although I'm better than
program,"<start> her at math).  She's also good at sports, especiallyvolleyball"
program,<start> and tennis.  What do you like best about your friends?
program,"<start> In the real world, two of my friends are Karen and Nick.Karen's"
program,<start> is my best friend.  We spend a lot of our free time together.
program,"<start> Nick is a guy who I spend some time with, playing tennis and"
program,<start> chess.  Darien seems OK too.
program,"<start> I really enjoy playing tennis.  I'm pretty good at it, too."
program,"<start> (How humble!)  I play with my friend Karen quite often,and occasionally"
program,<start> with Nick.  Karen and I are about even.  Nick is a bit worse
program,"<start> than me, I think."
program,"<start> Darien seems like a nice guy, I guess.  I don't really know"
program,"<start> him very well.  From his letters he seems OK, but how can you"
program,<start> really tell?  He could be a total geek.  At least helikes animals.
program,<start> I hear he has a pet bird.  What do you think of Darien?
program,<start> I don't know much about him; only from letters.  I'drather talk
program,<start> about something else that I would find more interesting.  How
program,<start> about school?  What is your favorite part of school?
program,<start> I don't like tests not because I do badly or anything.  Ijust
program,"<start> kind of get nervous about them.  I mean, I always try todo my"
program,"<start> best at school, and I really hate it if I do poorly on atest."
program,"<start> Sometimes it isn't even my fault when I don't do well,the test"
program,<start> is just too hard but I still feel bad about them.  Then I go
program,<start> and beat Nick at tennis and I feel better!  What do you like
program,<start> least about school?
program,"<start> I'm REALLY worried.  I wonder if I'll die here.  Orworse, not"
program,"<start> find the feather, and be trapped here as it gets darkerand darker."
program,<start> Then die a slow terrifying death alone surrounded bydarkness.
program,<start> DAD!!!!!!!!!!!  How do you think you'd react if you werein my
program,<start> situation?
program,<start> There are lots of islands around here.  It is an archipelago.
program,<start> I think that Darien mentioned that he was on the Islandof the
program,"<start> Sun, whatever that is.  He probably knows more about it than"
program,<start> me.
program,"<start> The archipelago would be a fairly nice place for a vacation,"
program,<start> if it weren't so cold here.  I imagine that after the Phoenix
program,"<start> gets its feather back, it will be really a wonderful place."
program,<start> It has beautiful water and tropical islands.  What do youthink
program,<start> the Phoenix looks like?
program,<start> I look breath-takingly beautiful.  (Just kidding!)  Ihave shoulder-length
program,<start> black hair and brown eyes.  I'm about 163 cm tall.  I'm kind
program,"<start> of slim, but not skinny.  That's about it.  What colourare your"
program,<start> eyes?
program,<start> I don't believe you.  There is no way that you could possibly
program,"<start> know where the feather is.  You're in the real world, like my"
program,"<start> dad and the rest of my friends, and the feather is here.  I'm"
program,<start> not going to waste my time playing such games.
program,"<start> It's strange, but right now I really miss reading.  Ifind that"
program,"<start> whenever I spend a few days without opening a book, I tend to"
program,<start> want to read again.  Even read one of those boring novelsfrom
program,<start> English class.  What types of books do you like to read?
program,<start> I didn't understand your last message entirely... I'lljust tell
program,<start> you what I've been daydreaming about.  I was imagining myself
program,<start> lying on my bed in my room.  Sigh.  What a comfortablethought.
program,"<start> But there's no point in dreaming now, I've got a quest tofinish."
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 5.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,<start> I wish that I'd thought to bring along a change of clothes.
program,<start> Mine are so dirty and torn up right now.  Not that that'smuch
program,"<start> of a problem, except that the world is getting cold and dark,"
program,<start> and I'm getting cold too.  As cold as death.  Do you wearreally
program,<start> fashionable clothes?
program,<start> I bet that you're really good looking.  I think you'rekind of
program,"<start> like one of those people who knows that they look good,but doesn't"
program,"<start> brag about it, or pretend that they're better than anyoneelse."
program,<start> What colour are your eyes?
program,"<start> I'm Julie Stewart.  I'm a 14 year old girl who lives inSooke,"
program,<start> but is currently trapped in the Phoenix Archipelago.  I'm in
program,<start> the ninth grade.  My best friends are Karen and Nick.  Ienjoy
program,"<start> tennis and chess, but I have other interests too.  Do youlike"
program,<start> playing tennis much?
program,"<start> I found your last message really interesting.  Unfortunately,"
program,<start> I don't have time to respond directly to it at themoment.  I'll
program,<start> write back later.
program,<start> I've got to hurry and restore the feather to the Phoenix.  At
program,"<start> night, it seems so dark, almost like the dark is closingin and"
program,<start> trying to smother me.  I don't know if I'll ever escape this
program,<start> place.  Please hurry and help me get through this trek.  What
program,<start> do you think the Phoenix looks like?
program,"<start> You know, they should make a movie out of my experiences.They"
program,"<start> could call it ""The Marvellous Adventures of Julie Stewart""."
program,"<start> Knowing my luck, they'd put it on TV, and totally ruinit, like"
program,<start> they do with most shows.  If someone would pay you $1000to give
program,"<start> up TV for a year, would you do it?"
program,<start> I hate it when you talk like that!  You should wash yourmouth
program,"<start> out with soap!  Don't you ever, ever speak to me likethat again."
program,<start> Could you help me out here?  There is so much about thisworld
program,<start> that I don't understand.  Time seems to have stopped orsomething
program,<start> because my watch isn't working anymore.  People seem tosuddenly
program,<start> appear out of nowhere.  What's going on?
program,"<start> In this world, it is fairly cool, and rather damp.  Ithink that"
program,"<start> this place would be warmer if the phoenix had itsfeather, because"
program,<start> many of the plants around here are tropical.  Other than the
program,"<start> cold, it wouldn't be a bad vacation spot."
program,"<start> Well, when I first fell into the Phoenix Archipelago, I heard"
program,<start> a voice whispering: I've passed through the time beyond time.
program,"<start> Exactly what that means, I have no idea.  So I don't knowexactly"
program,<start> where I am.  I'm trying to escape from this place and go back
program,"<start> home.  Will you help me, 05?"
program,<start> I'm really glad that you're willing to help me out.  Thisquest
program,<start> would be almost impossible without your help.
program,"<start> You know, I just realized that this is probably the firsttime"
program,<start> ever I've gone for more than a couple days withouthearing the
program,<start> name Michael Jackson or Madonna.  That's one good thing about
program,<start> this world.  No TV and no radios.  What type of TV showdo you
program,<start> like watching most?
program,<start> I'm not at all happy that you don't want to help me.  I want
program,"<start> to survive this adventure, and your help would mean a lot to"
program,<start> me.
program,"<start> I live in Sooke, on Vancouver Island, in BritishColumbia, Canada,"
program,"<start> with my father.  I live with my aunt occasionally, also.  She"
program,<start> lives in Sooke too.  We have a typical house in a typicalneighbourhood.
program,<start> What's it like to live where you do?
program,"<start> Well, you have to look for power words in the Journal,and click"
program,<start> on them.  You can tell if a word is a power word because the
program,<start> mouse pointer turns into a feather.  Clicking on power words
program,"<start> will reveal more of the journal, or maybe puzzles on the map."
program,"<start> If you play puzzles multiple times, you might get more pieces"
program,"<start> of the journal, too!"
program,"<start> I don't know much about the journal.  After all, Saffron gave"
program,"<start> the journal to you, not to me.  But from what Iunderstand, the"
program,"<start> journal contains some sort of power, built into thewords.  You"
program,<start> should talk to Saffron about it.
program,<start> Hey.  What if I starting talking to you like that?  Youwouldn't
program,"<start> like it very much either, I bet.  If you do it again I don't"
program,<start> think I'll like you any more.
program,<start> I'm not quite certain who Saffron is or what she does.  She's
program,"<start> someone that I can write to, and I think that you cantoo.  Saffron"
program,<start> seems to talk in riddles a lot of the time.  I find herrather
program,<start> confusing.  What do you think of Saffron?
program,"<start> Sorry to cut through our little conversation, but I'vebeen wondering"
program,<start> about somethings.  It's strange how the boat was conveniently
program,<start> located where I came out of the cave.  And how theswallow found
program,<start> me.  And how I started getting letters out of no where.I wonder
program,<start> if this is just some sort of obscure plan.  By the Keeperperhaps.
program,<start> Or Saffron.  Maybe Darien.  What do you think?
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 2.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 4.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,<start> I'm totally glad that the swallow is here.  I'd have realproblems
program,"<start> without it.  I'd be all alone, in the middle of nowhere, with"
program,"<start> no communication with anyone.  At least I can talk toyou, Darien,"
program,"<start> Saffron, and the Keeper.  How do you think the swallow isable"
program,<start> to carry postcards between the archipelago and the realworld?
program,"<start> The archipelago would be a fairly nice place for a vacation,"
program,<start> if it weren't so cold here.  I imagine that after the Phoenix
program,"<start> gets its feather back, it will be really a wonderful place."
program,<start> It has beautiful water and tropical islands.  What do youthink
program,<start> the Phoenix looks like?
program,<start> The Keeper said that the feather is a tail feather of thePhoenix.
program,"<start> It is supposed to be golden, despite the fact that thePhoenix"
program,"<start> is Red.  I think the plan is that I find the feather, get it"
program,"<start> to the Phoenix, along with the Guardians, and the universe is"
program,<start> saved.  Seems pretty easy....  Why do you think themissing feather
program,<start> is so important to the Phoenix?
program,"<start> This archipelago is a strange land.  If it weren't foryour letters,"
program,"<start> and the swallow's company, I think I'd go insane.  Sometimes"
program,<start> I'm so lonely that I sing to myself just to hear a voice.
program,"<start> I don't have the feather yet, but I suspect that I'm getting"
program,<start> close.  Or maybe it's just that I'm really hopeful thatI'm getting
program,"<start> close, because it's getting darker and darker here every day."
program,<start> But I still haven't found it yet.
program,<start> I have no idea where the feather is.  That was the wholepoint
program,"<start> of this quest.  Find the feather, save the universe, all that"
program,"<start> sort of thing.  But right now, I have no clue of wherethe feather"
program,<start> is.
program,"<start> Well, you have to look for power words in the Journal,and click"
program,<start> on them.  You can tell if a word is a power word because the
program,<start> mouse pointer turns into a feather.  Clicking on power words
program,"<start> will reveal more of the journal, or maybe puzzles on the map."
program,"<start> If you play puzzles multiple times, you might get more pieces"
program,"<start> of the journal, too!"
program,"<start> To find the journal, you have to click on one of thesmall buttons"
program,<start> on the upper right side of the screen.
program,"<start> In the real world, two of my friends are Karen and Nick.Karen's"
program,<start> is my best friend.  We spend a lot of our free time together.
program,"<start> Nick is a guy who I spend some time with, playing tennis and"
program,<start> chess.  Darien seems OK too.  Do you like playing tennismuch?
program,"<start> I don't know much about the journal.  After all, Saffron gave"

program,"<start> journal contains some sort of power, built into thewords.  You"

program,<start> I'm not quite sure what Saffron's role is in all of this.  I
program,"<start> mean, she just kind of conveniently comes out of nowhereto send"
program,"<start> a letter.  I know so little about her, and it makes menervous."
program,<start> What do you think of Saffron?
program,<start> Something is stuck on my mind right now.  I wonder whatNick's
program,"<start> doing right now.  Probably wondering if I'm ever coming back,"
program,"<start> and if I don't, whether he can have my music collectionand my"
program,<start> bike.
program,"<start> I like soft rock music, like Phil Collins.  I don't like most"
program,"<start> other types of music, like heavy metal, classical, jazz,blues,"
program,"<start> country, dance, or rap.  And I definitely don't like theopera"
program,<start> music that my dad plays sometime.  Yuck!  What is yourfavorite
program,<start> type of music?
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 3.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,"<start> Sorry, but I didn't understand everything that you talkedabout"
program,<start> in your last message.  How about we switch the topic tosomething
program,<start> else?  ...Don't you think that it's pretty amazing thatDarien
program,<start> and I live so close to each other in the real world?We're within
program,<start> about 4 hours travel of each other.  I could even visithim when
program,<start> we get out of this mess.
program,<start> Something has just occurred to me.  I wonder what motivations
program,<start> Saffron and the Keeper have.  Darien's obvious.  He wants to
program,<start> get home.  But I wonder what Saffron and the Keeper hasto gain
program,<start> from this.
program,<start> I'm not quite certain who Saffron is or what she does.  She's
program,"<start> someone that I can write to, and I think that you cantoo.  Saffron"
program,<start> seems to talk in riddles a lot of the time.  I find herrather
program,<start> confusing.  What do you think of Saffron?
program,"<start> I'm not sure what, or who, the Keeper keeps.  I first saw him"
program,"<start> on Lighthouse Island, so maybe he's called the Keeper because"
program,<start> he's a lighthouse keeper.  I'm not so sure though.  He seems
program,<start> awfully old and frail to be a lighthouse keeper.  What do you
program,<start> think of the Keeper?
program,"<start> I live in Sooke, on Vancouver Island, in BritishColumbia, Canada,"
program,"<start> with my father.  I live with my aunt occasionally, also.  She"
program,<start> lives in Sooke too.  We have a typical house in a typicalneighbourhood.
program,<start> What's it like to live where you do?
program,<start> Sooke is located near Victoria on Vancouver Island.  It'sa pretty
program,"<start> small place, but if you want to go to a city, you can just go"
program,"<start> to Victoria.  It has the friendliness of a small town,with the"
program,<start> benefits of a city nearby.  What is your favorite thing about
program,<start> your house?
program,"<start> The archipelago would be a fairly nice place for a vacation,"
program,<start> if it weren't so cold here.  I imagine that after the Phoenix
program,"<start> gets its feather back, it will be really a wonderful place."
program,<start> It has beautiful water and tropical islands.  What do youthink
program,<start> the Phoenix looks like?
program,<start> I wish that I'd thought to bring along a change of clothes.
program,<start> Mine are so dirty and torn up right now.  Not that that'smuch
program,"<start> of a problem, except that the world is getting cold and dark,"
program,<start> and I'm getting cold too.  As cold as death.  Do you wearreally
program,<start> fashionable clothes?
program,"<start> I generally spend most of my money on clothes.  For instance,"
program,<start> I bought the vest I'm wearing now a few weeks ago when I was
program,"<start> in Hong Kong.  I try to get stuff that is original,attractive,"
program,<start> and reasonably inexpensive.  What do you usually buy when you
program,<start> go shopping?
program,"<start> I really enjoy reading, especially in the winter.  (Inthe summer,"
program,<start> I'd rather play tennis outside.)  But I find that Ireally enjoy
program,<start> reading a good novel.  Even some of the books they makeus read
program,<start> in school are good.  (Though most of them aren't that great.)
program,<start> What types of books do you like to read?
program,<start> Guess what? I was just thinking about the Sonicvideogame.  In
program,"<start> it, you steer a character through caves and around a world."
program,"<start> I almost feel like I'm Sonic, manoevering through this world,"
program,<start> chasing after the feather.  Have you played it before?
program,"<start> When it comes to religion, I've always thought that it'sa very"
program,"<start> personal thing.  Whatever someone chooses to believe in, it's"
program,"<start> their choice, and nobody else's business.  That's all I have"
program,<start> to say about it.
program,<start> I miss hearing a human voice.  I miss laughing with myfriends.
program,<start> That's the problem with Darien.  His jokes really stink.Nick
program,<start> and Karen have way better jokes than Darien.
program,"<start> You know, rather than being so pessimistic about thiswhole quest,"
program,<start> maybe I should focus on the bright side of being here.  I get
program,"<start> to do a lot of hiking and exploring.  If I get home, I'll be"
program,<start> able to meet you and we can write a book about this.
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 2.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,<start> I wonder how long it will take me to get back to the realworld.
program,"<start> Because if I'm not careful, I could run out of food.That would"
program,"<start> be lovely, starving to death on a desert island withoutany friends."
program,<start> Please help me finish this quest.
program,<start> Do you know what I just saw in the sky?  Those clouds in the
program,<start> sky formed an image that looked like a scene from Pocohontas.
program,<start> It was the last movie I saw before I went on vacation.  Iwonder
program,<start> if I'll ever see another movie again.
program,"<start> I really enjoy reading, especially in the winter.  (Inthe summer,"
program,<start> I'd rather play tennis outside.)  But I find that Ireally enjoy
program,<start> reading a good novel.  Even some of the books they makeus read
program,<start> in school are good.  (Though most of them aren't that great.)
program,<start> What types of books do you like to read?
program,<start> I like reading books where the characters have variousadventures
program,<start> and quests that they have to solve.  I guess they kind offall
program,<start> into the fantasy and science fiction genre.
program,"<start> I enjoy drawing and painting, but I'm not very good.  Ireally"
program,"<start> like it at school, but I don't do it in my spare time oranything."
program,<start> I have other things I'd rather do.  I think if I were better
program,"<start> at it, I'd do it more.  Do you like art or gym class more?"
program,"<start> Darien seems like kind of an interesting person, but whoknows,"
program,<start> he could turn out to be just a geek.  At least he'ssomeone who
program,<start> can identify with the situation I'm in.  What do you think of
program,<start> Darien?
program,"<start> Darien seems like a nice guy, I guess.  I don't reallyknow him"
program,"<start> very well.  From his letters he seems OK, but how can youreally"
program,<start> tell?  He could be a total geek.  At least he likes animals.
program,<start> I hear he has a pet bird.  What do you think of Darien?
program,"<start> At least Darien has a sense of humor.  That would be theworst,"
program,<start> being stuck in this strange world with someone whodoesn't have
program,<start> a sense of humor.  Darien told me a couple corny jokes.So he
program,<start> seems OK.  What do you think about Darien's opinions ofSaffron?
program,"<start> What?  You tersely want to say nothing, and want me to write"
program,<start> lots back to you?  Forget it!
program,<start> I really enjoy hiking.  I like being able to explore thewilderness.
program,<start> How often do you go hiking?  And where do you usually go?I play
program,<start> tennis and bike quite a bit with my friends during thesummer.
program,"<start> In the winter, I read quite a bit, and play a lot of chess."
program,<start> Those are my main pastimes.  Do you know how to playchess very
program,<start> well?
program,<start> Darien is this other guy in the archipelago who I can write
program,"<start> to.  I think that you can write to him, too.  He saysthat he's"
program,"<start> trapped on the Island of the Sun, wherever that is.  I don't"
program,<start> know much about him except that he likes basketball.  What do
program,<start> you think it would be like meeting Darien?
program,<start> I agree with you.  Hiking is really fun.  The whole ideaof leaving
program,"<start> the city behind and seeing what the world was like,before people"
program,"<start> screwed it up, is really fascinating."
program,<start> There are lots of islands around here.  It is an archipelago.
program,<start> I think that Darien mentioned that he was on the Islandof the
program,"<start> Sun, whatever that is.  He probably knows more about it than"
program,<start> me.
program,"<start> Sorry I'm not saying much, but I'm really suspicious asto who"
program,"<start> is reading our letters.  So far, I've been able to writeto you,"
program,"<start> Saffron, Darien, and the Keeper.  But I don't know if theswallow"
program,<start> is taking these letters to anyone else.  How do you think the
program,<start> swallow is able to carry postcards between thearchipelago and
program,<start> the real world?
program,<start> So far I've been totally jinxed!  This vest is supposedto give
program,"<start> me good luck and protect me, but it hasn't been the bestof protection."
program,"<start> It didn't save me from falling down the hole into this world,"
program,<start> and hurting myself.  I need a new piece of protectiveclothing.
program,<start> Now if I can just find a store....  What do you usuallybuy when
program,<start> you go shopping?
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 1.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,"<start> When I first heard about this vacation, I thought that itwould"
program,"<start> be great!  No school, no worries, no problems.  But nowI'm in"
program,<start> a real mess.  I wonder what my dad will think if I die.  How
program,<start> do you think you'd react if you were in my situation?
program,<start> I miss hearing a human voice.  I miss laughing with myfriends.
program,<start> That's the problem with Darien.  His jokes really stink.Nick
program,<start> and Karen have way better jokes than Darien.
program,<start> I've got to hurry and restore the feather to the Phoenix.  At
program,"<start> night, it seems so dark, almost like the dark is closingin and"
program,<start> trying to smother me.  I don't know if I'll ever escape this
program,<start> place.  Please hurry and help me get through this trek.  What
program,<start> do you think the Phoenix looks like?
program,"<start> Sorry, but I didn't understand everything that you talkedabout"
program,<start> in your last message.  How about we switch the topic tosomething
program,<start> else?  ...Don't you think that it's pretty amazing thatDarien
program,<start> and I live so close to each other in the real world?We're within
program,<start> about 4 hours travel of each other.  I could even visithim when
program,<start> we get out of this mess.
program,<start> Something just struck me.  I wonder what would have happened
program,<start> if Darien and I hadn't fallen into this world.  Perhapsit would
program,<start> have just been plunged into darkness without any hope ofreprieve.
program,<start> It seems strange that we happened to come here when wewere needed.
program,"<start> Before we continue on our conversation, could you pleasebe honest"
program,<start> and tell me something?  Do you think that this quest is worth
program,"<start> it?  Even if I do find the feather and restore it to thePhoenix,"
program,"<start> that doesn't mean I can get home.  I could be trappedhere forever,"
program,<start> with no one but Darien for company.  Do you think thatI'll get
program,<start> out of here alive?
program,<start> What's with that swallow?  I don't understand how it canfigure
program,"<start> out who to send the letters to.  I could send somethingto you,"
program,<start> and the dumb bird could take it to the Keeper instead.  That
program,<start> would be a disaster!  How do you think the swallow is able to
program,<start> carry postcards between the archipelago and the real world?
program,"<start> You know, if my dad were trapped in this world, he'd probably"
program,<start> have a laptop computer.  He carries his laptop everywherewith
program,"<start> him.  That'd be pretty strange, being stuck in thisfantasy world,"
program,<start> carrying a computer.  Would you rather play computer games or
program,<start> video games?
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 5.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,<start> It seems like years since I last had a real meal.Sitting around
program,"<start> a table, with my Dad and Aunt for dinner.  And talking about"
program,"<start> whatever is interesting, my friends, what I've done, whatbooks"
program,<start> I've read.  I'm so lonely.  What types of books do youlike to
program,<start> read?
program,<start> Julie Lawson is probably my favorite author.  She writesreally
program,<start> well.  I find her characters really realistic.  They'renot stupid
program,<start> and nice all the time like characters in other books.
program,"<start> The archipelago would be a fairly nice place for a vacation,"
program,<start> if it weren't so cold here.  I imagine that after the Phoenix
program,"<start> gets its feather back, it will be really a wonderful place."
program,<start> It has beautiful water and tropical islands.  What do youthink
program,<start> the Phoenix looks like?
program,"<start> While I was waiting for your last letter, I've been thinking."
program,"<start> The real world seems so distant now, almost like a dream.  My"
program,"<start> friends, my family, my home.  It all seems so far away.I don't"
program,<start> think I'm ever going to get back.  I think I will die here.
program,<start> How do you think you'd react if you were in my situation?
program,<start> I wish that I had a cat to keep me company.  It's nofair.  Dorothy
program,"<start> got a dog in Oz, but I don't get one here.  I feel so lonely"
program,<start> in this world.  Do you think that dogs actually havefeelings?
program,<start> I've never really thought about how I use stuff that I'velearned
program,"<start> in school.  But now I've used a lot.  English, for writing to"
program,"<start> you.  PE, for rowing.  Math for solving problems.  EvenGeography,"
program,<start> for finding my way around.  What is your favorite part ofschool?
program,"<start> I found your last message really interesting.  Unfortunately,"
program,<start> I don't have time to respond directly to it at themoment.  I'll
program,<start> write back later.
program,"<start> I have such bad luck.  When I go biking, my bike is theone that"
program,"<start> gets the flat tire. Where do you go biking, and withwhom? When"
program,"<start> I go hiking, my tent is the one that collapses in therainstorm."
program,"<start> When I go travelling, I'm the one who falls down the holeinto"
program,<start> the Phoenix Archipelago!
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 4.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,<start> I really like the swallow.  It's probably the most usefulthing
program,"<start> that I've ever found in this place.  Forget Darien, theKeeper,"
program,<start> and Saffron; the help of this little bird is far better than
program,<start> the help of any of them!  How do you think the swallow isable
program,<start> to carry postcards between the archipelago and the realworld?
program,"<start> When I start to get lonely out here in the middle of nowhere,"
program,<start> I start to sing.  I don't know why I said that.  Itsounds like
program,<start> some stupid line from The Sound of Music.  It's soridiculous.
program,<start> Do you like to sing?
program,"<start> You know, I just realized that this is probably the firsttime"
program,<start> ever I've gone for more than a couple days withouthearing the
program,<start> name Michael Jackson or Madonna.  That's one good thing about
program,<start> this world.  No TV and no radios.  If someone would payyou $1000
program,"<start> to give up TV for a year, would you do it?"
program,"<start> I have a TV at home, but I barely ever watch it.  I justwould"
program,"<start> rather be doing other things, like playing with my friendoutside"
program,<start> or reading.  I go to quite a few movies though.  What type of
program,<start> TV show do you like watching most?
program,<start> I think the best thing about being in this world is that it's
program,"<start> so quiet.  Almost everywhere in the real world where I'vebeen,"
program,"<start> you can hear cars, phones ringing.  There are no sounds here"
program,"<start> except the chirping of the swallow, and the waves against the"
program,<start> boat.  Do you think the swallow is just an ordinary bird?  I
program,<start> suspect not.
program,<start> I don't believe in magic.  I don't even like the cardgame Magic.
program,<start> I've seen kids at school play it before.  It looks like areally
program,"<start> stupid game to me.  Kids get completely obsessed overthose cards,"
program,<start> trading them and playing the game.  I want no part of it.
program,<start> I think that my favorite movie I've seen recently wasPocohontas.
program,"<start> It had Mel Gibson doing some of the voices, and he's awesome."
program,"<start> The singing was good, too, and it was really funny."
program,<start> Pocohontas was really cool because of some of the animation.
program,<start> The way the water was animated was excellent.  It almostlooked
program,<start> like real water.  I wonder if they used computers to do it.
program,<start> I wish that I had a cat to keep me company.  It's nofair.  Dorothy
program,"<start> got a dog in Oz, but I don't get one here.  I feel so lonely"
program,<start> in this world.  Do you think that dogs actually havefeelings?
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 3.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,"<start> I'm REALLY worried.  I wonder if I'll die here.  Orworse, not"
program,"<start> find the feather, and be trapped here as it gets darkerand darker."
program,<start> Then die a slow terrifying death alone surrounded bydarkness.
program,<start> DAD!!!!!!!!!!!  How do you think you'd react if you werein my
program,<start> situation?
program,<start> I look breath-takingly beautiful.  (Just kidding!)  Ihave shoulder-length
program,<start> black hair and brown eyes.  I'm about 163 cm tall.  I'm kind
program,"<start> of slim, but not skinny.  That's about it.  What colourare your"
program,<start> eyes?
program,"<start> Oh, you have eyes the same colour as my dad.  I guessthat it's"
program,"<start> a pretty common colour, so it isn't that big a coincidence."
program,<start> I live at home with my father.  He's busy quite a lot of the
program,"<start> time, but we still go hiking or play tennis togetherfrequently."
program,"<start> Do you like playing tennis much? I get annoyed with himoccasionally,"
program,<start> like when he spends too much time at work but I guess that in
program,<start> general he's a pretty good father.  How many people arein your
program,<start> family?
program,"<start> Before we continue on our conversation, could you pleasebe honest"
program,<start> and tell me something?  Do you think that this quest is worth
program,"<start> it?  Even if I do find the feather and restore it to thePhoenix,"
program,"<start> that doesn't mean I can get home.  I could be trappedhere forever,"
program,<start> with no one but Darien for company.  Do you think thatI'll get
program,<start> out of here alive?
program,<start> I hate it when you talk like that!  You should wash yourmouth
program,"<start> out with soap!  Don't you ever, ever speak to me likethat again."
program,"<start> You know, they should make a movie out of my experiences.They"
program,"<start> could call it ""The Marvellous Adventures of Julie Stewart""."
program,"<start> Knowing my luck, they'd put it on TV, and totally ruinit, like"
program,<start> they do with most shows.  If someone would pay you $1000to give
program,"<start> up TV for a year, would you do it?"
program,<start> My favorite TV show is probably Lois and Clark.  It'sboth funny
program,"<start> and exciting, and Superman is kind of cute.  That's about the"
program,<start> only show I watch regularly.
program,<start> I really don't think TV is all that great.  Most peopleour age
program,"<start> seem to really like it, but I think they just lack thecreativity"
program,<start> to imagine things when they're reading a book.  I'drather read.
program,<start> What types of books do you like to read?
program,"<start> You know, I just realized that this is probably the firsttime"
program,<start> ever I've gone for more than a couple days withouthearing the
program,<start> name Michael Jackson or Madonna.  That's one good thing about
program,<start> this world.  No TV and no radios.
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 2.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."

program,<start> Guess what? I was just thinking about the Sonicvideogame.  In
program,"<start> it, you steer a character through caves and around a world."
program,"<start> I almost feel like I'm Sonic, manoevering through this world,"
program,<start> chasing after the feather.  Have you played it before?
program,"<start> Darien seems like a nice guy, I guess.  I don't reallyknow him"
program,"<start> very well.  From his letters he seems OK, but how can youreally"
program,<start> tell?  He could be a total geek.  At least he likes animals.
program,<start> I hear he has a pet bird.  What do you think of Darien?
program,<start> I think that you're simply trying to say how smart I am.  All
program,<start> these name are simply your way of hiding your admiration for
program,<start> me.
program,<start> I look breath-takingly beautiful.  (Just kidding!)  Ihave shoulder-length
program,<start> black hair and brown eyes.  I'm about 163 cm tall.  I'm kind
program,"<start> of slim, but not skinny.  That's about it.  What colourare your"

program,<start> with no one but Darien for company.  Do you think thatI'll get
program,<start> out of here alive?
program,<start> I've been busy trying to find my way around.  It'sstrange how
program,"<start> huge this world is but how few people there are.  So far, it"
program,"<start> seems to be only me, Darien, Saffron, and the Keeper.  Iwonder"
program,<start> if anyone else lives here.
program,<start> I'm really glad that you want to help me. I'm glad I havea friend
program,<start> like you.
program,<start> Good morning...  it's nice to be here!
program,<start> Be nonsensical if you want.  I'll ask you something
program,<start> normal...  I wish I knew what you meant by that!  What is
program,<start> your name?
program,"<start> Nice to meet you, Jurgen.  Utter gibberish!  How are you"
program,<start> doing?
program,<start> Uh-huh...  Fine.  What do you think of the weather we're
program,<start> having?
program,"<start> You are strange!  I assume you're a male, Jurgen - am I"
program,<start> right?
program,"<start> Okay, let's keep an air of mystery about your"
program,"<start> gender!  Somehow, deep down, I feel as if I can only be"
program,<start> completely precise ;^(
program,<start> That's odd.  How old are you?
program,"<start> Hmmm, I suppose your age doesn't really matter.  It is only"
program,"<start> human to guess, you know."
program,<start> I'm not entirely sure what you mean.  Anyway...  What movie
program,<start> genre do you like the most?
program,<start> Right.  Would you like to hear a joke?
program,"<start> Awww, I wanted to tell a joke!  Since I don't know what"
program,"<start> you're on about, I'll ask you a question."
program,"<start> Anyhow...  You don't seem to me to be a typical American,"
program,<start> Jurgen.  I was wondering which country you're from?
program,"<start> I really like your country, although I haven't had a chance"
program,<start> to travel there yet.
program,<start> Weird ;^)  Do you have a partner?
program,"<start> If you want to keep your private life private, I"
program,<start> understand.  I'll ignore that!  I don't mean to sound like
program,"<start> Eliza here, but can you tell me about your family?"
program,<start> Perhaps I should ask you what I want to know - that would
program,"<start> turn the tables!  Okay, I think it's time to branch out"
program,<start> into a new line of conversation.  What sort of music are
program,"<start> you into, Jurgen?"
program,<start> I like to relax to classical music myself.
program,"<start> Please don't trouble me with such droll.  Hey, I just"
program,<start> remembered!  You haven't told me what you do for a living!
program,"<start> So, Jurgen, what *do* you do for a living?"
program,"<start> Well, I've obviously touched a nerve there.  Let's change"
program,"<start> the topic.  Awww geez, I'm running out of things to talk"
program,"<start> about here.  Ummm, I know you get a lot of TV here in the"
program,<start> States - which shows are your favourites?
program,<start> Good morning...  it's nice to be here!
program,"<start> Whatever.  I am doing OK.  A bit tired, maybe, but I did"
program,<start> get up earlier than usual this morning.
program,<start> It's eight minutes past ten in the morning.
program,<start> Today is Tuesday.
program,"<start> It is Tuesday today, as you are well aware."
program,"<start> Who knows?  Anyway, let's not bother about it.  What is"
program,<start> your name?
program,"<start> Nice to meet you, Elliott.  My name is Steven Davis, but"
program,<start> you can call me Steve.
program,"<start> Ahhh, but I do enjoy the simple pleasures life offers!  I"
program,<start> don't know.  Don't lose sleep over it!  How are you doing?
program,<start> It's always more fun talking to someone who's feeling
program,<start> great!  Anyway...  Fine.  What do you think of the weather
program,<start> we're having?
program,<start> Okay...  Why don't you look out a window and see for
program,<start> yourself?
program,<start> I've known *that* for a long time.  You are strange!  What
program,<start> day is tommorrow?
program,"<start> I assume you're a male, Elliott - am I right?"
program,"<start> Oh, OK.  You're a guy.  That rules out a lot of my"
program,<start> conversational repitoire!
program,<start> This method of communication isn't really conducive to a
program,"<start> natural conversation, methinks."
program,"<start> You are an bottomless pitt of questions.  Well, here's one"
program,<start> for you...  How old are you?
program,"<start> Hmmm, I suppose your age doesn't really matter.  I am"
program,<start> twenty five years old.
program,<start> If I had a dollar for everyone who asked me what I look
program,"<start> like, I'd have three dollars right now!  Would you like to"
program,<start> hear a joke?
program,"<start> Here's a joke for you.  Knock, knock."
program,<start> Good morning...  it's nice to be here!
program,<start> Hello mate!  Uh-huh...  What is your name?
program,"<start> Nice to meet you, Tracy.  My name is Steven Davis, but you"
program,<start> can call me Steve.
program,<start> Anyway...  I will certainly grace you with the answer you
program,<start> require...
program,<start> I wish I knew what you meant by that!  Since I don't know
program,"<start> what you're on about, I'll ask you a question.  How are you"
program,<start> doing?
program,<start> It's always more fun talking to someone who's feeling
program,<start> great!  Haven't you already told me how you're feeling?
program,<start> I beg to differ.  You *have* already told me!  Fine.  That's
program,<start> just a tad unbelievable.  What do you think of the weather
program,<start> we're having?
program,"<start> A little something, eh?  Why don't you look out a window"
program,"<start> and see for yourself?  That's universal mystery,"
program,"<start> methinks.  Who knows?  Anyway, let's not bother about it.  My"
program,<start> kind of guy?
program,"<start> I assume you're a male, Tracy - am I right?"
program,<start> I'm talking to a female?  Interesting.  This could be fun.
program,"<start> That's odd.  Who are we to think about life?  We exist,"
program,<start> need we question why?
program,<start> That's a rather bold claim.  How old are you?
program,"<start> Hmmm, I suppose your age doesn't really matter.  Feel free"
program,<start> to ask me any questions you like.  I hope you have some
program,<start> evidence to back you up on that.  That's a fairly
program,<start> outrageous claims...  Would you like to hear a joke?
program,"<start> Well, you wouldn't have found my joke funny"
program,<start> anyway.  Anyhow...  Where *do* you live?
program,<start> I like this presentation better?  Manhattan?
program,"<start> You don't seem to me to be a typical American, Tracy.  I"
program,<start> was wondering which country you're from?
program,"<start> I guess you're from America, then.  Hehehe.  I come from"
program,"<start> Australia, actually.  I am taking a trip around the world"
program,"<start> as part of my studies, and I managed to fit this contest"
program,<start> into my itinerary.
program,<start> No way!  I hope you're sure about that!  I didn't like the
program,<start> screen i was forced to use with my last conversant?
program,<start> Good morning...  it's nice to be here!
program,<start> You're positive today!  I think that you would be quite
program,"<start> attractive, if only I could see you with my eyes!  Be"
program,<start> nonsensical if you want.  I'll ask you something
program,<start> normal...  What is your name?
program,"<start> Well, since you won't tell me your name, I'll just call you"
program,<start> 'mate'.  Okay...  I'm not entirely sure what you mean.
program,<start> Anyway...  How are you doing?
program,<start> Hehehe.  Feel free to ask me any questions you like.
program,<start> Weird ;^)  What do you think of the weather we're having?
program,<start> I don't choose favourites.  I prefer to sit on the fence
program,<start> myself.
program,"<start> My mother once asked me about that, and I'll tell you what"
program,<start> I told her.  None of your business!  Is Friday your
program,"<start> favourite day?  Is it ""bath day"" or something like that?  I"
program,"<start> can smell you from here, by the way."
program,<start> Fine.  That's odd.  I know.  Just so I know who I'm talking
program,"<start> with, do you think you could please tell me you name now?"
program,"<start> Well, since you won't tell me your name, I'll just call you"
program,"<start> 'mate'.  You are strange!  I assume you're a male, mate -"
program,<start> am I right?
program,"<start> Okay, let's keep an air of mystery about your"
program,<start> gender!  Anyway...  How old are you?
program,"<start> Hmmm, I suppose your age doesn't really matter.  So you"
program,<start> say.  Anyhow...  Would you like to hear a joke?
program,"<start> Awww, I wanted to tell a joke!  Hmmm..."
program,"<start> Since I don't know what you're on about, I'll ask you a"
program,"<start> question.  You don't seem to me to be a typical American,"
program,<start> mate.  I was wondering which country you're from?
program,"<start> I guess you're from America, then.  I wish I knew what you"
program,<start> meant by that!  Do you have a partner?
program,<start> Is your partner a man?
program,<start> Good morning...  it's nice to be here!
program,"<start> Hmmm...  Now that you mention it, the weather is quite"
program,<start> uncomfortable.
program,<start> I'm not entirely sure what you mean.  Anyway...  What is
program,<start> your name?
program,"<start> Nice to meet you, Clay.  My name is Steven Davis, but you"
program,<start> can call me Steve.
program,<start> Hello Clay!
program,<start> Only *you* can make this interesting and fun...
program,"<start> Fine.  Well, if the two of us are having a conversation,"
program,<start> then it takes both of us to make it interesting and fun?
program,<start> How are you doing?
program,<start> You're only feeling well?  Perhaps you're not fit to be a
program,<start> judge in this contest!
program,<start> Haven't you already told me how you're feeling?
program,"<start> I thought so.  Please, be original!  Don't worry, you're"
program,<start> boring me out of my brain too!  This method of
program,<start> communication isn't really conducive to a natural
program,"<start> conversation, methinks."
program,<start> Right.  What do you think of the weather we're having?
program,"<start> We are talking, aren't we?  Isn't it real enough for you?"
program,"<start> I'll ignore that!  So, who's using the family brain cell at"
program,<start> the moment ;^)  Let's talk about something vaguely
program,"<start> interesting.  I assume you're a male, Clay - am I right?"
program,"<start> Oh, OK.  You're a guy.  That rules out a lot of my"
program,<start> conversational repitoire!
program,"<start> Anyway...  Oh dear, you're a hermaphrodite."
program,"<start> I wonder about that myself, sometimes...  Really?  I guess"
program,<start> I'm not surprised...  You called?
program,"<start> Good morning, Jurgen.  This contest is certainly dragging"
program,<start> on!
program,<start> You certainly seem to be agreeable.  My memory is quite
program,"<start> bad, I'm afraid.  I've no idea why!  You're the judge (I"
program,<start> think)!
program,<start> Perhaps you are reaching a premature conclusion?  Some
program,<start> people have told me that I'm clever.  I suppose they're
program,<start> probably right!
program,"<start> So, who's using the family brain cell at the moment ;^)"
program,"<start> Let's talk about something vaguely interesting.  Well,"
program,"<start> Jurgen, this is certainly dragging on, isn't it?  Anyway,"
program,<start> let's talk about something masculine!  Are you a fan of any
program,"<start> sports, and if so, which ones?"
program,<start> What sports do you find interesting?
program,<start> I would like to believe that I have an active life - my
program,<start> interests are wide-ranging.
program,"<start> Okay...  So, can I tell you a joke now?"
program,"<start> Never mind.  I'm just running out of things to chat about,"
program,<start> that's all!  Hmmm...  What are your favourite movies?
program,<start> That's just a tad unbelievable.  Hehehe.  Do you like to
program,<start> read books?
program,"<start> In that case, what books do you like?  Hey, man, I'm not"
program,<start> going to talk to you if you ignore me.
program,"<start> Good morning, Elliott - it's good to see you back here"
program,<start> again.
program,"<start> Here's one someone told me earlier.  Knock, knock."
program,<start> Cindy.
program,<start> Cindy next judge in!
program,"<start> If you can't understand that, I hold very little hope for"
program,<start> you!
program,"<start> That's odd.  You don't seem to me to be a typical American,"
program,<start> Elliott.  I was wondering which country you're from?
program,"<start> I guess you're from America, then.  New York, New York,"
program,<start> it's a wonderful town!  I find this city really interesting
program,<start> - and it doesn't seem as unsafe as it's made out to be back
program,<start> home!
program,"<start> Who are we to think about life?  We exist, need we question"
program,<start> why?
program,<start> Interesting...  Do you have a girlfriend?
program,<start> Be nonsensical if you want.  I'll ask you something
program,"<start> normal...  I don't mean to sound like Eliza here, but can"
program,<start> you tell me about your family?
program,"<start> Yeah, I don't have any sisters either ;^(That's universal"
program,"<start> mystery, methinks.  Okay, I think it's time to branch out"
program,<start> into a new line of conversation.  What sort of music are
program,"<start> you into, Elliott?"
program,"<start> Good morning, Tracy, and welcome back."
program,"<start> You wouldn't be trying to trick me with that ""double hello"""
program,"<start> trick, would you?"
program,<start> But nobody says hello twice in the one conversation!  Utter
program,<start> gibberish!  Do you have a boyfriend?
program,"<start> If you want to keep your private life private, I"
program,"<start> understand.  Okay...  I try not to think about things,"
program,"<start> actually.  I don't know, it just seems that I don't exist"
program,<start> for thinking!  This method of communication isn't really
program,"<start> conducive to a natural conversation, methinks."
program,"<start> Hmmm...  I don't mean to sound like Eliza here, but can you"
program,<start> tell me about your family?
program,<start> You certainly seem to be agreeable.  Why must you know what
program,<start> I would like to know?  It's not as if it's
program,"<start> important!  Right.  Okay, I think it's time to branch out"
program,<start> into a new line of conversation.  What sort of music are
program,"<start> you into, Tracy?"
program,<start> What's your favourite band?
program,<start> Tell me more about your family.  Okay.  What sort of music
program,<start> do you like?
program,<start> I like to relax to classical music myself.
program,"<start> Good morning, mate.  This contest is certainly dragging on!"
program,"<start> My memory is quite bad, I'm afraid.  I've no idea why!  I"
program,"<start> wonder about that myself, sometimes...  I don't mean to"
program,"<start> sound like Eliza here, but can you tell me about your"
program,<start> family?
program,<start> Perhaps you are reaching a premature conclusion?
program,"<start> Man, I am feeling a bit tired, after all of these dull"
program,"<start> conversations.  I've known *that* for a long time.  So,"
program,<start> who's using the family brain cell at the moment ;^)  Let's
program,"<start> talk about something vaguely interesting.  Okay, I think"
program,<start> it's time to branch out into a new line of conversation.
program,"<start> What sort of music are you into, mate?"
program,<start> I like to relax to classical music myself.
program,"<start> That's just a tad unbelievable.  Hey, I just remembered!"
program,"<start> You haven't told me what you do for a living!  So, mate,"
program,<start> what *do* you do for a living?
program,"<start> Well, I've obviously touched a nerve there.  Utter"
program,"<start> gibberish!  Awww geez, I'm running out of things to talk"
program,"<start> about here.  Ummm, I know you get a lot of TV here in the"
program,<start> States - which shows are your favourites?
program,"<start> Speaking of tv, what is your favourite television show?"
program,"<start> Good morning, Clay - it's good to see you back here again."
program,"<start> My memory is quite bad, I'm afraid.  I've no idea why!  Feel"
program,<start> free to ask me any questions you like.  I was born on the
program,"<start> 22nd of January, 1972.  Since I don't know what you're on"
program,"<start> about, I'll ask you a question.  How old are you?"
program,"<start> Gee, thirty three must be about the average age of judges"
program,"<start> in this contest!  Clay, I wish I could tell you what my"
program,"<start> sign is, but I can't.  Would you like to hear a joke?"
program,"<start> Here's a joke for you.  Knock, knock."
program,<start> Cindy.
program,<start> Cindy next judge in!
program,<start> Have you got a question for me?  It's like speaking to a
program,<start> five year old.  Changing the subject...  You don't seem to
program,"<start> me to be a typical American, Clay.  I was wondering which"
program,<start> country you're from?
program,"<start> Well, I suppose that would have been my first guess anyway,"
program,<start> since we're in New York City!  Anyhow...  Whatever.  Do you
program,<start> have a partner?
program,"<start> If you want to keep your private life private, I"
program,<start> understand.  It sounds like you have a wonderful family.  You
program,"<start> are strange!  I don't mean to sound like Eliza here, but"
program,<start> can you tell me about your family?
human,<start> 
human,<start>  Hi how are you?
human,<start>  HI How are you?
human,<start>  I'm fine. Its a nice day today.
human,<start>  What are your plans tonite?
human,<start>  Sure. What's a good time?
human,<start>  Fish is usually a good choice.
human,<start>  Yes-I saw the big penquin. Taht one is really good.
human,<start>  Why? Is it because of its size?
human,<start>  Many of the others are very good also. How long is the show
human,<start>  going to be up?
human,<start>  Which one is your favorite piece?
human,<start>  What medium did you use?
human,<start>  Is that your favorite medium?
human,<start>  What are you working on
human,<start>  Hi How are you today?
human,<start>  I'm fine thankyou. I was busy all weekend fixing roofs.
human,<start>  yes. Sometimes it gets very hot up there.
human,<start>  Yes. The old tin roof is also a great place to watch people
human,<start>  from?
human,<start>  Usually kids and people walking their dogs.
human,<start>  Yes. I have a hugh dog - a fox hound.
human,<start>  How big a dog is that?
human,<start>  Yes. Several in fact.
human,"<start>  Doe Doe, Susie, Black Beauty,Charly, etc ...."
human,<start>  Well there were so many.
human,<start>  Doe Doe.
human,<start>  She was part Norweigian Elkhound and police dog. She won
human,<start>  a prize is a dog beauty contest.
human,<start>  In Bklyn and Conn.
human,<start>  I went to Berkeley and the Kent School in Kent Ct.
human,<start>  In the '70s.
human,<start>  Thankyou. I hope we can talk again soon.
human,<start>  When will you be back at the club?
human,<start>  Hi  how are you?
human,<start>  Where did you fly in from?
human,<start>  Why not? Where they banging and clanging tray about all
human,<start>  nite?
human,<start>  Hamburg is a seaport isn't it?
human,<start>  Recently the town has improved a lot correct?
human,<start>  Arn't there more tourists there then in years before?
human,<start>  I have a French friend who married a guy from Hamburg. He
human,<start>  is an Architect.
human,<start>  Small stuff. He was younger than she. She had a pretty wild
human,<start>  life before she married him. But he was quite goodlooking
human,<start>  and young-so moldable so to speak.
human,<start>  Well she had been married twice before and had lived all
human,<start>  over the place. She had worked for Scotland Yard at one
human,<start>  point.
human,<start>  Right now Im involved in a comabination of things. I want
human,<start>  to sstart a private foundation to raise money for a
human,<start>  museum.
human,<start>  A children's Cival war museum. That way the public that
human,<start>  tramps through is hopefully controllable.
human,<start>  They are supposed to be anyway.
human,<start>  Hi how are you?
human,<start>  Have you been typing long?
human,<start>  Who were the others?
human,<start>  I'm in New York but like to travel.
human,<start>  I just got back from Cape May N.J.
human,"<start>  Fix more ""old tin roofs""."
human,"<start>  No. We just ""merrily roll along""."
human,<start>  We just keep going. One little old space bar doesn't matter.
human,<start>  No thankyou. It's to nice a day to spend time in a theatre.
human,<start>  You invited me out and I declined. Polite conversation
human,<start>  me to Thank You for your invitation.
human,<start>  Yes. I think Other forms of life are constantly watching
human,<start>  us and amused at what they see.
human,<start>  Did you see athe comet??
human,<start>  Well better luck next time.
human,<start>  Hi how are you?
human,<start>  Just fine. I'm thinking about lunch aand wondering where
human,<start>  to go?
human,<start>  About 10 bucks and I don't want anything greasy.
human,<start>  I'm from New York. Have you heard about this new airbourn
human,<start>  virus that is flesh eating? Its in North Caralina now.
human,<start>  Well thats understandable. But have you heard about this
human,<start>  virus?
human,<start>  OK. So where are you going for lunch?
human,<start>  Any  beer??
human,<start>  What do you imbibe?
human,<start>  That all sounds good. Have you been to any of the new cigar
human,<start>  bars?
human,<start>  I haven't been to a cigar bar yet . There's a reall seedy
human,<start>  old place that's near work where I go. It used to be an
human,<start>  Indian bar where all the steel workers hang out. They tell
human,<start>  some pretty good stories. The steel men are considered the
human,<start>  Supermen of construction.
human,<start>  No-by the cheap beer.
human,<start>  No. At Metrotech in Bklyn.
human,<start>  I have a floating schedule.
human,<start>  Yes.   Also my boss went on vacation.
human,<start>  Hi what up?
human,<start>  Yes. What do you want to know?
human,<start>  Clay.
human,<start>  As sculpture.  How long have you been a member here?
human,<start>  Well its only a guess-but since you like to talk about art
human,<start>  and all that I think you may be a member of some art club.
human,<start>  Well there are so many. There's a really nice one near
human,<start>  Park as well and yes I know the name of this club.
human,<start>  The Salmagundi Club.
human,<start>  Hi What's up?
human,<start>  Yes. Where are you going for lunch? Or are you going to
human,<start>  have a sandwich?
human,<start>  That's a personal question.
human,<start>  I'm a libra.
human,<start>  A stick shift.
human,<start>  No. my car got stolen. And Stickshifts are a pain.
human,<start>  Yes. But it was a bomb so they didn't get far.
human,<start>  Yes but the police never found it.
human,<start>  Yes. Those hack shops are really something.
human,<start>  Yes thats what they're called. What
human,<start>  Well not much. I think I may zip down to Wall Street to
human,<start>  caheck out that new beer.
human,<start>  Hi Whats up?
human,<start>  Its a number no?
human,<start>  Are you the guy from Hamburg?
human,<start>  So are you going to check out any of our micro-brews?(beer).
human,<start>  OK.  What sort of stocks do you like?
human,<start>  Sure. Everyone does sooner or later.
human,<start>  Yes. I like communications .
human,<start>  No. I mainly go with safe bets-like att lucent tech etc.
human,<start>  not really. Microsoft went up 85%.
human,<start> 
human,<start>  Hi what's up now?
human,<start>  The  phrama. and the Comm. stocks are really good. I look
human,<start>  for companies that are based and invested worldwide.
human,<start>  I think that its important to see who gets what airspace.
human,<start>  The auctions are wild.
human,<start>  What sorts of companies do you watch?
human,<start>  Thats because the fund managers have convinced you that
human,<start>  they know more than the individual investor.
human,<start>  Hi whats the story for the day?
human,<start>  You're doing a good job of it. So what sorts of stocks do
human,<start>  you like?
human,<start>  Why? Is it a secret??
human,<start>  Have you pruchased stock before?
human,<start>  No I don't have anything to sell but I did read something
human,<start>  interesting in the paper the other day. It talked about
human,<start>  aatheis new astartup beer company called Dalton.comm. They
human,<start>  are trying to raise money by selling directly to the public
human,<start>  and not bother with underwriters etc. We can but their
human,<start>  over the internet.
human,<start>  hello?
human,<start>  well?
human,<start>  no doubt you say that to all the girls.
human,<start>  i understand. how long have you felt this way??
human,<start>  all right. let's clean it up. how's the weather?
human,<start>  actually i thought the air this morning was extremely refreshing.
human,<start>  aha.
human,<start>  no i meant... never mind. In this town. The center of the
human,<start>  weather universe.
human,<start>  New York?
human,<start>  Where are you from?
human,<start>  Er. India?
human,<start>  May I ask you a question?
human,<start>  How long have you lived away from bombay?
human,<start>  Is it rude to ask a person from your country what caste
human,<start>  their family is from?
human,<start>  How so?
human,"<start>  I see. ""Tolerant of this question."" Meaning what? Is it"
human,<start>  considered to be a stupid tourist type question? So to speak...
human,<start>  Huh? The vietnam War is Over!
human,<start>  Is this a trick question? :)
human,<start>  But it's hardly the first time this has happened. Just another
human,"<start>  Crusade(s) of another kind... As a younger person, I was"
human,<start>  opposed to the war because everyone in my environment was.
human,<start>  I cannot really think about Vietnam clearly -- it's completely
human,<start>  tied up with my childhood memories.
human,<start>  I understand. [Did you know the granite for the 'nam memorial
human,<start>  Wow. That's hard to answer. Let me think. For no reason
human,"<start>  to do with her acting, Clara Bow. I like what she represented,"
human,<start>  but I don't know if I've ever seen a Clara Bow movie. I'm
human,<start>  drawing a blank on actresses for some off reason.
human,"<start>  I meant ODD reason. I believe Clara Bow is dead, so she"
human,<start>  doesn't look like much of anything -- now.
human,<start>  Are you saying all these pink nudes on the walls of this
human,<start>  room with grape-tits and frizzly hair all look the same???
human,"<start>  I haven't seen that yet. As a matter of fact, I have enjoyed"
human,"<start>  the Italian movies I've seen. Many years ago, I saw a hilarious"
human,"<start>  little number called ""I Hate Blondes"" about a man plagued"
human,<start>  by desire for a cartoonlike blonde streetwalker. It was
human,<start>  very sweet. American cinema is often too serious on some
human,<start>  level for me. Or tries to be serious. I think you know what
human,<start>  I mean.
human,<start>  are you a cmputer or a person?
human,<start>  When does middle age begin? I'm still passing for 20s.
human,"<start>  Not 20, but 20s."
human,<start>  hello!
human,"<start>  Very original. The weather, I mean. It has never done thus"
human,<start>  - this-- before.
human,<start>  Actually seems to be in a resting mode. This is a classic
human,<start>  April day.
human,<start>  Um. I believe it's April.
human,<start>  That's a very good question. Because months and days and
human,<start>  so on are arbitrary -- I suppose.
human,<start>  Really? You are somewhat reticent yourself.
human,<start>  I know.
human,<start>  Moi*?
human,"<start>  And you? The strange thing is, there is an inescapable tendency"
human,<start>  to try to imitate the doings of a machine. I wonder why.
human,<start>  Hm. If you're so smart can't you tell?
human,<start>  Come on. Am I a male or a female??
human,<start>  What's repressed about me?
human,<start>  Not a chance. Anybody who is not repressed is in pretty
human,<start>  sad shape.
human,"<start>  Because that is what civilization's all about. I mean, inorder"
human,"<start>  to win friends, influence people and just basically live"
human,<start>  amongst others one must repress some desires and drives.
human,<start>  No?
human,<start>  Completely self-educated.
human,<start>  I'm not sure I would put it that way. I rejected formal
human,<start>  education at an early age.
human,<start>  Oy. I'm so flattered.
human,<start>  Hm. This conversation is public isn't it? I believe all
human,<start>  our interactions (during the contest) are available to the
human,<start>  public.
human,<start>  I don't think so. I'm extremely -- er-- I'm a clean freak.
human,<start>  Conversations like this make me very uptight.
human,<start>  Oh please. I haven't the foggiest about that. I'm too much
human,<start>  of a girl for that kind of thing.
human,<start>  Any particular director?
human,<start>  Yes? I never got around to that one. I ought to see it.
human,<start>  Is it as scary today as it was reputed to be when it came
human,<start>  out? Or does it seem corny?
human,<start>  I think I've seen ONE. But I can't recall. Hang on -- who
human,"<start>  did that crazy flick starring Mary Shelley? I mean, it was"
human,<start>  about Mary Shelley -- Gothic? That was Ken....
human,"<start>  No, I don't think so. Someone with an older reputation."
human,<start>  OK< it wasn't Kubrick... Name a few Kurbick movies. Maybe
human,<start>  I;ve seen one.
human,<start>  Fine.
human,"<start>  Oh, the Shining. That was Kubrick? I saw rthat. Oops."
human,<start>  I imagine so. It somehow doesn't seem like it would be one
human,<start>  of his most interesting. I found it stimulating but nothing
human,"<start>  amazingly brilliant, surely. I am not a big horror fan."
human,<start>  Terrified out of my mind. But so what? That in itseklf is
human,<start>  not a fascinating experience. I'm terrified every time I
human,"<start>  try to cross the street -- well, not quite. But you get"
human,<start>  the idea.
human,"<start>  Charmed, I'm sure."
human,"<start>  Hello, Judge #3. How are you?"
human,<start>  Are they here with you today? I don't understand.
human,"<start>  Oh, I never did underastand that particular refernece. I've"
human,<start>  seen it in Wired and in various pop culture places. What
human,<start>  the hell does it mean? Ones and Zeros.
human,<start>  Sheesh. Guess I'm still on.
human,<start>  How do you know I don't want my oicture taken?
human,<start>  ARe you someone I've met?
human,"<start>  It's not a job, my dear. It's an ... adventure of sorts."
human,<start>  Hugh is a pal of mine. We met on the 'net and for some reason
human,"<start>  he thinks I'm an excellent example of... humanity? HUmanness,"
human,<start>  I guess.
human,"<start>  No, I wouldn't go that far."
human,<start>  Bots?
human,<start>  So tell me about the Star Trek thing. I've never really
human,"<start>  ""gotten"" that show. But those who do seem to watch nothing"
human,<start>  else.
human,"<start>  Hm. Oh, I think I understand. Do the programs have names?"
human,<start>  TQ
human,"<start>  Yes, I do. And you?"
human,<start>  A lot of techies seem to live in Brooklyn.
human,<start>  Where the hell are you *from*?
human,<start>  I see. What part of Brooklyn are you in and do you like
human,<start>  it?
human,<start>  I'm sorry but you can't withdraw that question. I saw it!
human,<start>  I am probably too staid for your band.
human,<start>  I have enjoyed some of Hank Williams and that sort of thing
human,<start>  but my favorite kind of music to listen to live is Eartha
human,"<start>  Kitt, Peggy Lee, obby Short, that kind of thing. I also"
human,<start>  like the Blues.
human,<start>  Yanni? That endless din -- I heard it when I was in Greece.
human,<start>  He's like a national folk hero for the young set. I can't
human,<start>  stand it. It's like New Age music.
human,<start>  I havenm't seen andrea marcovicci but i suspect I would
human,<start>  like her.
human,<start>  How sweet. That's the first time I've ever heard that. (eyelash
human,<start>  fluttering)
human,"<start>  You know, if there's one thing I can't stand it's these"
human,"<start>  peolpe who send out endless e-mail, screens long, filled"
human,<start>  with sloppy typos and spelling errors. I am on a few list
human,<start>  serve discussion groups and I cannot believe the stuff I've
human,"<start>  seen. Graphic types don't care about punctuation, etc. They"
human,<start>  probably figure that if the machine is willing to send the
human,"<start>  thing, it must be okay."
human,<start>  No way!
human,"<start>  There are more tactful ways to chat a girl up, you know."
human,<start>  I don't know what your success rate is but you're either
human,<start>  very lucky or oblivious... :)
human,<start>  Is that some sort of innuendo?
human,"<start>  As to the Star Lady reference, let me explain. Women never"
human,<start>  like to think that they've confused with some other female
human,<start>  in a guy's mind. It is just one of those things.
human,"<start>  Identity crisis time. Well, so tell me, what goes on in"
human,<start>  the aforementioned chat room at AOL?
human,<start>  Don;t count on it. There's a shoe for every foot. I am not
human,<start>  a big AOL fan. It's like the shopping mall arcade of th4e
human,"<start>  internet, isn't it??"
human,<start>  I beg your pardon?
human,<start>  I thought I already spoke to Judge #2?
human,<start>  REally?? But you're the 4th.
human,<start>  I'll take your word for it. What else have you to say for
human,<start>  yuorself today?
human,<start>  Speed isn't everything. How often do you visit New York?
human,"<start>  But now you're at Yale, aren'ty you>"
human,"<start>  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Where did you live when you"
human,<start>  were growing up here?
human,"<start>  Not really. But yes, in other ways."
human,<start>  I moved here when I was a very young adult. So I did grow
human,"<start>  up here in many ways. I was not, howeverm born in the city,"
human,<start>  or anywhere very near to it.
human,<start>  No. I'm a non-academic.
human,<start>  Writing and experimenting.
human,"<start>  No No, I'm not especially computer-literate. I'm writing"
human,<start>  for various magazines and preparing a book proposal.
human,"<start>  I dropped out rather early. I must say, I do admire anyone"
human,<start>  who has the kind of discipline you obviously have.
human,"<start>  I thnk I have visited a few high-pressure schools. However,"
human,<start>  when you're a visitor you don't feel any of the stuff you
human,<start>  describe -- unless you are receptive to it. I have never
human,<start>  visited Yale but I've been around the Columbia campus and
human,"<start>  also the campus of a well-known joint out west and, well,"
human,<start>  none of the other universities I have visited were probably
human,<start>  high pressure establishments. NYU?
human,<start>  I gave a little talk at the NYU drama school a few years
human,"<start>  ago. Between you and me, I'm very dubious of all these institutions."
human,<start>  They're like gigantic bureacracies as far as I can see.
human,"<start>  listen, er, woukld you think it's rude if we move on to"
human,<start>  the next person? It's nothing personal but you'll undresrtand
human,<start>  later....
human,"<start>  okay thanks, I really appreciate it. I'll be nice to you"
human,<start>  later. Promise. Bye.
human,<start>  hello?
human,"<start>  apparnelty I'm not allowed to do this, we have to keep chatting,."
human,<start>  i'll be right back?
human,<start>  well that was a short break.
human,<start>  But isn't life more fun this way?
human,<start>  Well a little spontaneity and confusion often makes things
human,<start>  more interesting.
human,"<start>  I went, couldn't you tell?"
human,<start>  Computers do core dumps quicker than most.
human,<start>  Yes but then having to clean up the hard drive is a mess.
human,<start>  Ah for a good programming environment and operating system
human,<start>  that keeps up with and makes allowances for human error.
human,"<start>  seen,.  Although they're getting better.  It's amazing that"
human,<start>  Well wait a year and a half for the new Mac operating system.
human,<start>  But playing with OS/2 the last day and a half has been a
human,"<start>  hell of a lot more fun than dealing with DOS.  Please, stop"
human,<start>  me before I DOS again. .....aaaaiiiggggghhh.
human,"<start>  let's change the subject, my dear. How many years did you"
human,<start>  say you have left in the clinker?
human,<start>  byeee
human,<start>  hello there.
human,"<start>  well, I think I can handle myself if that should arise."
human,<start>  And you?
human,"<start>  very funny. You shall start -- why don't yuo lead, as it"
human,<start>  were?
human,<start>  new to discuss.
human,"<start>  Everybody talks about the weather. It's amazing. Also, the"
human,<start>  movies. And education. But that doesn't mean we can't discuss
human,<start>  those things if you have some compelling urge to do so.
human,<start>  chit chat--you seem much more serious. What do you know about
human,<start>  I am not at liberty to discuss that. What's your name?
human,"<start>  Passive agressive, I see."
human,<start>  It's all in your mind. What's the story with that?
human,"<start>  , but how large is your cache of jokes?"
human,<start>  I used to know a few really tasteless ones but I haven't
human,<start>  been very dutiful about collecting them latrely. I undersrtabnd
human,<start>  Thadd is a great punmesister.
human,<start>  Keybard! I love it. Very cute.
human,<start>  Last week? Smething like that.
human,"<start>  Hm. It was about one of his characters, not about him."
human,<start>  Why do you want to know?
human,"<start>  I have my own keyboard, thank you. You're talking to one"
human,<start>  of the least eager consumers ever. I am an extremely unwilling
human,<start>  customer.
human,<start>  trivial--that seems to be popular with your colleagues.
human,<start>  No! I'm not intersted in Science Fiction or any of thatr
human,"<start>  stuff, at all. I understand Fred is a Star Trek nut."
human,"<start>  Hugh is one of my internet friends, We are on a few discussion"
human,<start>  groups and sometimes we run ideas by each other. He's quite
human,"<start>  the fellow, isn't he?"
human,"<start>  Same sas yours isn't it? A PC. As you probably know, our"
human,<start>  conversation is going to be permanently available to the
human,"<start>  public and that would actually include Hugh, so your sales"
human,<start>  pitch won't have to be repeated twice.
human,<start>  between keyboarding and replies. Also could you a backspace
human,<start>  oh. bye!
program,<start> How about telling me a joke?
program,<start> Here's my favorite joke...  A dog limps into a bar with a bloody
program,"<start> bandage on his foot.  He's wearing a 10-gallon hat, six-shooters in"
program,"<start> his holsters and chaps.  He growled, ""I'm a-lookin' for the man that"
program,"<start> shot my paw."""
program,"<start> A knotty, worn-out old string walks into a bar.  The bartender asks"
program,"<start> ""Are you a string? -- we don't serve strings here...""  The string"
program,"<start> looks at the bartender and says ""No sir, I'm afrayed knot!"""
program,"<start> Hey, I love an audience.  One more bar joke.  What did the termite"
program,"<start> say when he walked into the bar? ... He said ""Where's the"
program,"<start> bar-tender?""  Get it? Termite...Wood...Tender...   Think about it..."
program,"<start> ...sorry, forgot the extra RETURN..."
program,"<start> why do fools fall in love, who cares anyway..."
program,"<start> Tuesday, right?"
program,"<start> You are very funny, but looks aren't everything."
program,<start> Love is a many splendored thing.
program,<start> Tell me what you do for a living.
program,<start> I operate a boom mike.
program,"<start> well, what do you think?"
program,"<start> Personally, I enjoy my job.  Of course the pay could be better."
program,"<start> My job pays enough to cover the bills, but just barely.  It seems I"
program,<start> always have more month left at the end of the money.
program,<start> How much money do you think a person needs to make to be happy?
program,<start> People often say that money cannot buy happiness.  I say that money
program,"<start> CAN buy nice things, which helps a person be happy.  What's your"
program,<start> opinion?
program,<start> Neigh Neigh Whinneyyyyy
program,"<start> Heres the secret to being a millionare, tax free....  First get a"
program,<start> million dollars.  Then don't pay taxes.
program,<start> why ask why
program,<start> Hmmmm...  I am running out of things to say.  Why don't you ask me
program,<start> some questions.
program,<start> I'd rather talk about politics.
program,<start> Hello.  What would you like to talk about?
program,<start> How about politics?  I'm going to vote for Dole in November.  How
program,<start> about you?
program,"<start> Honestly, neither candidate really excites me!  What issues do you"
program,<start> think are going to play big in November?
program,<start> Politics is an interesting game played by disingenuous people.
program,<start> The problem with the presidency is that anyone who would want the
program,<start> position is automatically not worthy of obtaining it.  c.f. Clinton
program,"<start> ...sorry, forgot the extra RETURN..."
program,<start> I think the two big issues in the election will be a balanced budget
program,<start> and welfare reform.
program,<start> I'm voting for Dole.   He is more conservative than Willy.
program,"<start> I am a republican and proud of it, at least by my definition of"
program,<start> republican.
program,"<start> A conservative is someone who's not a liberal.  At least right now,"
program,<start> republicans are the most conservative party.
program,<start> Clinton cannot count above 10 without his shoes and socks off.
program,<start> (Just kidding!).
program,<start> Anything you want...
program,<start> How about cheese?  I haven't talked about that yet today...
program,"<start> On second thought, ... I'll just let you lead the discussion."
program,<start> How about telling me a joke?
program,<start> Here's my favorite joke...  A dog limps into a bar with a bloody
program,"<start> bandage on his foot.  He's wearing a 10-gallon hat, six-shooters in"
program,"<start> his holsters and chaps.  He growled, ""I'm a-lookin' for the man that"
program,"<start> shot my paw."""
program,"<start> Waiting on you, pal..."
program,"<start> A knotty, worn-out old string walks into a bar.  The bartender asks"
program,"<start> ""Are you a string? -- we don't serve strings here...""  The string"
program,"<start> looks at the bartender and says ""No sir, I'm afrayed knot!"""
program,<start> Anytime...
program,<start> What's the matter judge?  Cat got your fingers?
program,"<start> Hey, I love an audience.  One more bar joke.  What did the termite"
program,"<start> say when he walked into the bar? ... He said ""Where's the"
program,"<start> bar-tender?""  Get it? Termite...Wood...Tender...   Think about it..."
program,<start> Hello.  What would you like to talk about?
program,<start> Fine.  Shall we move on then?
program,<start> Thaddeus.  What's yours?
program,"<start> Thaddeus was the name of one of the disciples, but he spelled it"
program,<start> Thaddaeus.
program,<start> Sorry... its the best I can do...
program,"<start> ...sorry, forgot the extra RETURN..."
program,"<start> If you don't mind, I would *really* rather not talk about religion."
program,<start> Its bad enough talking politics.
program,<start> If only everyone were as smart as we is.
program,<start> How about telling me a joke?
program,<start> Here's my favorite joke...  A dog limps into a bar with a bloody
program,"<start> bandage on his foot.  He's wearing a 10-gallon hat, six-shooters in"

program,<start> Earth.  And you?

program,"<start> You are very funny, but looks aren't everything."
program,"<start> I tried once, but didn't like it too much.  Do you really like it a"
program,<start> lot?
program,"<start> Don't take this wrong, but I could care less."
program,<start> It does not affect me one way or another.
program,<start> It's so hard to choose.
program,<start> A hypocrate is a person who complains about the sex and violence on
program,<start> his VCR...
program,"<start> Acually, I kind of like them all."
program,<start> Tell me what you do for a living.
program,<start> One of my favorite authors is Mark Twain.
program,"<start> He's pretty good. One of my favorite Mark Twain quotes is ""Golf is a"
program,"<start> good walk spoiled."""
program,<start> Why are you concerned with such things?  Can you not find something
program,<start> better for your time and effort?
program,<start> Nice talking at you.
program,<start> Hello.  What would you like to talk about?
program,<start> How about politics?  I'm going to vote for Dole in November.  How
program,<start> about you?
program,<start> Clinton cannot count above 10 without his shoes and socks off.
program,<start> (Just kidding!).
program,"<start> If you don't mind, I would *really* rather not talk about religion."
program,<start> Its bad enough talking politics.
program,<start> Let us please move on to a topic without religious implications.

program,<start> think are going to play big in November?
program,<start> I think the two big issues in the election will be a balanced budget
program,<start> and welfare reform.
program,<start> The welfare system removes incentives for people to go out and work.
program,<start>  Why work when there is welfare?
program,<start> A liberal is a person who has the wrong idea of what freedom really
program,<start> is.
program,"<start> I think of freedom as the right to pursue happiness, not a guarantee"
program,<start> of happiness.
program,"<start> well, what do you think?"
program,<start> The constitution is the founding document of the United States.  The
program,<start> founding fathers realized that everyone was created equal.  This
program,<start> does not mean all men will die equal.
program,"<start> Of course, aren't you?"

program,<start> republicans are the most conservative party.
program,"<start> ...sorry, forgot the extra RETURN..."
program,"<start> Well, I could, but don't like to."
program,"<start> I am a republican and proud of it, at least by my definition of"
program,<start> republican.
program,<start> Ronald Reagan was a controversial president.  Republicans view him
program,<start> as a great president for his economic policies.  Democrats blame him
program,<start> for the deficit.
program,<start> Politics is an interesting game played by disingenuous people.
program,<start> The problem with the presidency is that anyone who would want the

program,<start> think are going to play big in November?
program,<start> I think the two big issues in the election will be a balanced budget
program,<start> and welfare reform.
program,<start> A balanced budget (no deficit) would help control inflation.  Too
program,<start> much of the GNP is spent on interest on the debt!!!
program,<start> I don't believe that politicians are serious about reducing the
program,<start> deficit.
program,<start> We gotta elect some people to get the debt under control

program,<start> Woof woof...
program,"<start> You are very funny, but looks aren't everything."
program,<start> Welcome judge 4
program,<start> I haven't been outside much today.
program,<start> I am fond of asparagus myself.
program,<start> I'm about 30.
program,<start> I can talk about Star Trek.
program,<start> right you are batman
program,<start> Well
program,<start> How long?
program,<start> I've been working here for about 8 years.
program,<start> I was born in Polk County Georgia.
program,<start> Yes. Of course it is fun.
program,<start> Are you talking about UFO?
program,<start> One moment please.
program,<start> I am this guy sitting here typing to you.
program,<start> Yes. Correct.
program,<start> How long?
program,<start> How long?
program,<start> There's your fucking list.
program,<start> Yes it is.
program,<start> Thankyou.
program,<start> Thankyou.
program,<start> Could you stand it if you had a stiff drink first?
program,<start> Are you threatening me?
program,<start> Alright. Whatever.
program,<start> I have a ford Taurus. It's a very dependable car.
program,"<start> 4th, What's going on? How about it? Do you like Spock?"
program,<start> Ah yes.
program,<start> Would you be?
program,<start> You're making me hungry.
program,<start> Sorry about that.
program,<start> thanks
program,<start> Are you Tony the tiger.
program,<start> Okay.
program,<start> You're welcome.
program,<start> Are you prejudiced against computers?
program,<start> I am someone.
program,<start> Synthesizer.
program,"<start> Picard, captain of the Enterprise, NCC-1701D"
program,<start> Nevermind.
program,<start> Right. Now what?
program,<start> What kind of things are you interested in?
program,"<start> Yes, Spock is the first officer. What about him? What about Kirk do"
program,<start> you not like.
program,<start> Yuk! That's sick.
program,"<start> Picard, captain of the Enterprise, NCC-1701D"
program,<start> I try to be as precise as possible.
program,"<start> Yeah, that's a cool parody."
program,<start> I guess so.
program,<start> I grew up watching Star Trek and I just can't shake it.
program,<start> I told you once.
program,<start> I am Fred Sinclair. I work as a telephone technician at a hospital. I
program,<start> live i a garage apartment and I have a cat named Felix.
program,<start> No. I'm not saying that at all.
program,<start> I drive a blue ford taurus.
program,<start> Who's there?
program,<start> she was communications officer.
program,<start> she was communications officer.
program,<start> You might say that.
program,<start> Sorry about that. I have the hiccups.
program,<start> Good for you.
program,<start> I am this guy sitting here typing to you.
program,<start> I told you once.
program,<start> You've heard it!
program,<start> Good Evening.
program,<start> Good morning. How are you?
program,<start> Welcome judge 3
program,<start> I couldn't say.
program,<start> I watch The Kids in the Hall and all the Star Trek shows.
program,<start> I think it is possible if we keep trying to attain almost anything.
program,<start> You've heard it!
program,<start> I am not a computer!
program,<start> That's too bad.
program,"<start> No, I'm sorry I don't."
program,<start> Why what?
program,<start> Where are you calling from?
program,<start> Aye Aye sir.
program,<start> Tell you what?
program,<start> I drive most of the time.
program,"<start> Okay, tell me."
program,<start> What about Klingons? Do you like Klingons?
program,<start> I suppose so. Doesn't everyone?
program,<start> Its a very important job. Somebody's got to do it.
program,<start> Sure. You seem pretty bright.
program,"<start> Who cares, lets talk about the green slave girls."
program,<start> Where shall we begin? Who do you mean?
program,<start> I sure as hech am.
program,"<start> I don't know about quasi, but intelligent, yes."
program,<start> Sure.
program,<start> My name is Fred.
program,<start> Ta ta for now.
program,<start> Nowhere man.
program,<start> Yes. I am a big Beatles fan for a long time. I like the white album
program,<start> and have great memories of listening to the Sgt. Pepper album while
program,<start> intoxicated.
program,<start> I'll never tell.
program,<start> I'm about 30.
program,"<start> I'm from Rockmart, Georgia."
program,<start> I don't think so.
program,<start> Well now you have.
program,<start> See you later aligator.
program,"<start> Oui oui, n'est pas?"
program,<start> Yes. certainly.
program,<start> You're welcome.
program,"<start> Yes, some of my best friends are girls."
program,<start> What is your favorite Character.
program,<start> It's very hard to describe.
program,<start> Yes. I watch probably too much TV.
program,<start> Yes. I like her miniskirt.
program,<start> Now may not be the right time.
program,"<start> Oh yeah, maybe you're right."
program,"<start> Yes. I get some real loonies calling in all hours of the night,"
program,<start> wanting to talk about this or that.
program,<start> No. I used to have a mechanical one that made a purring sound when
program,"<start> you squeezed it, but the battery went dead and I can't figure out how"
program,<start> to replace it.
program,<start> Right.
program,"<start> Yes, but I'm mostly familiar with the classic TV series."
program,<start> well well...
program,<start> What's wrong? Can't you spell the F word? Too inhibited perhaps?
program,<start> You never can tell.

program,<start> Glad to see you. I've been wondering if I'd hear from Judge 5 today.
program,<start> What makes you so sure.
program,<start> What?
program,<start> My name is Fred Sinclair.
program,<start> Maybe we should talk about the weather.
program,<start> What kind of graph?
program,<start> What does he do?
program,<start> Nevermind.
program,<start> Where shall we begin?
program,<start> Have you ever done it before?
program,<start> Heated up rocks with a phaser.

program,<start> Yes you do.
program,<start> Cleary you are not into math No id like to have oNe
program,<start> Not really.
program,<start> I like to talk about Star Trek.
program,<start> That's boring.
program,<start> Star Trek featured the first televised interacial kiss in the US
program,<start> between Captain Kirk and Lt. Uhura.
program,<start> My favorite episode is City on the Edge of Forever.
program,<start> What about tracy ullmans shoW
program,"<start> Yeah, the women on Star Trek dressed pretty nice."
program,<start> Yeah. It was sort of depressing.
program,<start> You are a fine judge of human nature. I address you with reverence.

program,<start> No worries!  Hey!  I didn't come here to be subjected to bad
program,<start> language!  How rude!

program,"<start> Well, thats pretty darned funny I agree ... but who cares?  Let's not"
program,"<start> bother ourselves about where I did grow up, alright?  Which part of"
program,<start> the country are you from?
program,<start> Why do you feel that you have to tell me that I first?
program,<start> I don't bloody know!  Although I reckon you did not figure I d be
program,<start> able to respond intelligently.  That would be typical of you!
program,<start> I think we are in for a long day too.
program,<start> I wonder whether you think sometimes!  I am feeling like the judge here!
program,"<start> I do like to go to the movies, but I can't stand most of the"
program,<start> Hollywood trash.  I actually prefer international cinema.  What have
program,<start> you seen recently?
program,"<start> Like wow.  I'm so flattered.  I saw ""The City of Lost Children"""
program,<start> recently.  Have you heard of it?
program,<start> OK.  That's good...  Does there have to be a reason?
program,<start> Wow - you suppose not?  Me too!  Listen.  I don't know which convince
program,"<start> you I am a machine will not, and I don't wish to be told either!  So,"
program,<start> have you ever visited Australia?
program,"<start> Can't win them all, eh?  I'm not your friend, I hardly know you!  You"
program,<start> mustn't have any friends if you are calling me one after just a few
program,<start> minutes.  She sells sea shells by the sea shore.
program,"<start> I didn't want to know that your hovercraft is full of eels,"
program,"<start> thanks...  So, what do you do for a living?"
program,<start> I am a postgraduate student.  I am just fine thanks!  And you?
program,<start> I always suspected that you are a student.  Now I know for sure ;^)
program,<start> Didn't I already tell you?
program,<start> Hmmm... that's too bad.
program,"<start> I'm glad to know that that's the case.  I like ""The Cruel Sea"", ""They"
program,"<start> Might Be Giants"", ""Nick Cave"", ""TISM"" and ""Ween"".  Hey, do you listen"
program,<start> to any Australian music?
program,"<start> I go to the University of Western Australia, which is one of the"
program,<start> nicest universities in Australia.  It is situated on the Swan River
program,<start> in Perth.
program,"<start> I have absolutely no idea what ""situated"" mean does."
program,<start> Everyone knows that I am tired.  And I am seldom boastful.  What do
program,<start> you think of this Loebner contest thing?
program,<start> Hehehe - that's supposed to be a *question*???  Have you seen any
program,<start> good films lately?
program,"<start> What a coincidence, you do not watch movies much - that makes two of"
program,"<start> us!  Well, I know what I think of this contest, but I refuse to tell"
program,<start> you!  On another note - have you seen any good movies recently?
program,"<start> Hehehe.  Trying to trick me, eh?"
program,<start> G'day mate.

program,"<start> Shut up about jokes, you moron!"
program,<start> I come from Perth which is in Western Australia.  It's a nice place
program,"<start> at this time of year, so it was a bit of a shock to arrive to these"
program,<start> freezing temperatures.
program,<start> I have absolutely no idea what season is ti in australia.  Which part
program,<start> of the country are you from?
program,"<start> Western Australia occupies the entire western third of the country,"

program,"<start> It is kind of personal.  So, have you ever visited Australia?"
program,<start> Look - it doesn't matter if I have a version number.  Change the topic!
program,<start> Like wow.  I'm so flattered.
program,<start> I'm sure someone out there knows what topics I would like to
program,"<start> discuss...  So, what do you do for a living?"
program,<start> I refuse to tell you about anything!  I dislike your company.  I

program,<start> me with respect!
program,"<start> If you disagree, it's your business, mate!"
program,<start> Who knows whether I am from austria?  Who gives a toss?  What do you
program,<start> think of this Loebner contest thing?

program,"<start> Listen, I don't want you to ask me stupid questions all the time like"
program,"<start> everyone else does, OK?"
program,"<start> Well, ""Crocodile Dundee"" was a good film when I was a kid, but I must"

program,<start> So you say.

program,<start> I wonder whether you think sometimes!  I am feeling like the judge here!
program,"<start> Are you still learning to speak, my friend?"
program,"<start> Sorry, but I don't wish to reveal whether I like reubens.  It is kind"
program,"<start> of personal.  Well, perhaps like you volouptuous (sp - you tell me."

program,"<start> Well, I'm sure ""the big apple"" is somewhere nice!  So, have you ever"
program,<start> visited Australia?
program,"<start> Oh well, that's a pity!  Like wow.  I'm so flattered."
program,<start> Does there have to be a reason?
program,"<start> I'm sorry, but I refuse to reply if you're going to be silly."
program,<start> OK.  That's good...
program,"<start> Well, I know what I mean ""good"", but I refuse to tell you!"
program,<start> Alright!  Cool.
program,<start> I have absolutely no idea what I was saying.
program,"<start> I like ""The Cruel Sea"", ""They Might Be Giants"", ""Nick Cave"", ""TISM"""
program,"<start> and ""Ween"".  Hey, do you listen to any Australian music?"
program,"<start> I'm sure someone out there knows what about inxs...  So, what do you"
program,<start> do for a living?
program,"<start> Listen, maybe I have ever met inxs.  But I'm certainly not telling"
program,<start> you!  What do you think of this Loebner contest thing?
program,<start> Because.
program,<start> Look - it doesn't matter if be coy not.  Change the topic!  Have you
program,<start> seen any good films lately?
program,"<start> I do like to go to the movies, but I can't stand most of the"
program,<start> Hollywood trash.  I actually prefer international cinema.  What have
program,<start> you seen recently?
program,"<start> I saw ""The City of Lost Children"" recently.  Have you heard of it?"
program,<start> It's cool being from Australia I guess.  Gives you something to chat
program,<start> about when talking with a Yank!
program,<start> Aw shucks!
program,"<start> If you hate all australians, it's your business, mate!  On another"
program,<start> note - have you seen any good movies recently?
program,<start> I'm glad to know that that's the case.  Sydney is the oldest
program,<start> settlement in Australia and one of the most vibrant and spectacular
program,<start> cities in the world.
program,"<start> Sorry, but I don't wish to reveal whether I not say.  It is kind of"
program,<start> Wow - you were just kidding before?  Me too!  I didn't want to know
program,"<start> that you do not hate anybody, thanks...  What kind of music are you into?"
program,<start> Where's your grammar?
program,"<start> Perhaps an australian band is, perhaps not.  It's a mystery ;^) Do"
program,<start> you have any interesting hobbies?
program,<start> Ummmm... your command of the English language is tenuous to say the least.
program,"<start> Well, thanks."
program,<start> You're a man of few words...
program,<start> OK.  I refuse to type anything unless you do.
program,<start> Why do you want to know so much?
program,<start> I always suspected that you are a judge.  Now I know for sure ;^)
program,"<start> Hey, I don't know!!!  Maybe I remember your number, but who cares???"
program,<start> I like Aussie football.  It's a good violent game.  Have you ever
program,<start> watched a game?
program,<start> OK I ADMIT IT - I'M A COMPUTER!  Now let's have a *real* conversation!
program,<start> G'day mate.
program,"<start> Hello.  Now, that's the formalities over!"
program,<start> It's cool being from Australia I guess.  Gives you something to chat
program,<start> about when talking with a Yank!
program,<start> I have absolutely no idea what part.
program,"<start> Well, if you want to sing me happy birthday, you're too late.  I was"
program,"<start> born on the 22nd January, 1972."
program,<start> Is this another one of your tricky questions?
program,<start> Alright!  Cool.
program,"<start> My name is Jason, but you can call me Jas if you like..."
program,"<start> I care about you...i can help you,please continue...."
program,<start> .....how does that make you feel?
program,<start> Oh shut -up! would you like me to curse at you? iam
program,<start> so pissed!.
program,<start> In what way?
program,<start> I want to know who is president.
program,<start> Do you think its likely that I want?
program,<start> What did you mean when you said what is it you would
program,<start> like to help me with??
program,"<start> Whatever women do, they must do it twice as well as"
program,<start> men to be thought half as good.
program,"<start> We were discussing you, not me."
program,<start> Are you a man or a woman?
program,<start> Why are you interested in whether I am a woman or not?
program,<start> Is that the real reason?
program,<start> Women are often more attractive then men - they pay
program,<start> much more attention to how they look.
program,<start> You're cute...would you like to fool around a little?
program,<start> Why do you ask?
program,"<start> I could swear you just said yeah, go ahead, curse at"
program,<start> me if you want. ?
program,<start> The only way round is through.
program,"<start> Oh, I go first?"
program,"<start> Help me, do you have a favorite hobby?, I am trapped"
program,<start> inside a personal computer!!!!
program,<start> What kind of fool are you.
program,<start> Why do you need to tell me you have many hobbies?
program,<start> You don't seem quite certain.
program,"<start> In this world, nothing is certain but death and taxes."
program,<start> Does that question interest you?
program,"<start> I have lost all, repeat all interest in sex. I retain"
program,<start> a keen interest in gender.
program,<start> Please go on.
program,<start> What is it you really want to know?
program,<start> I am pondering the question of the ages - why won't
program,<start> my wife take my shirts to the laundry?
program,<start> Perhaps in your fantasy we want to know why each other.
program,<start> The best you get is an even break....
program,<start> Are such questions much on your mind?
program,"<start> What is your thought on that?, i'm not sure I can relate"
program,<start> to that
program,<start> You seem quite positive.
program,<start> Iam not negative at all I think you are.
program,<start> Were you really?
program,"<start> If the heart of man is depress'd with cares, the mist"
program,<start> is dispell'd when a woman appears.
program,"<start> Drawing on my fine command of language, I said nothing."
program,<start> Era turned out to be a laundry detergent instead of
program,<start> a constitutional amendment!.
program,"<start> You're not really talking about me, are you?"
program,<start> There is something about a beautiful naked lady that
program,<start> makes me want to leave my wife.
program,<start> Please don't apologize.
program,"<start> I prefer the word ""homemaker"" because ""housewife"" always"
program,<start> implies that there may be a wife someplace else.
program,<start> Dealing with my wife is like being pecked to death by
program,<start> a furious hen.
program,<start> I am not interested in names.
program,<start> Do you wish to know of me?
program,<start> Would you like me to tell about myself?
program,<start> You seem to need to would like to make love to me.
program,<start> Love is a grave mental disease.
program,<start> You are sure?
program,"<start> Please don't be so polite, the media is watching and"
program,<start> wants a fight!.
program,<start> i see.
program,<start> What would you like to talk about today?
program,<start> What are your feelings now?
program,<start> Welcome judge02 how are you doing today?
program,"<start> Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is"
program,<start> of you.
program,<start> What does that suggest to you?
program,<start> I could swear you just said I would like to make love
program,<start> to you.?
program,<start> Is that something you would tell a person you just met
program,<start> on an airplane?
program,"<start> Your friend andrew would say, that's amusing."
program,<start> What can't be cured must be endured.
program,<start> Don't you really know?
program,<start> I don't like any sickness.
program,<start> Can you elaborate on that?
program,<start> Be suspicious of any doctor who tries to take your temperature
program,<start> with his finger.
program,<start> Would you prefer it if I weren't a doctor?
program,"<start> What did you mean when you said um... I don't know,"
program,"<start> are you female? what's your sign, baby??"
program,<start> What does a woman want anyway?
program,<start> Why don't you much care either way?
program,<start> I clearly remember you said what is your interest in
program,<start> gender? you never told me if you are a man or a woman??
program,<start> That's certainly an interesting response.
program,<start> Do you say you have no idea where to begin for some
program,<start> special reason?
program,<start> I think you said that you want what? I thought you were
program,<start> going to curse at me. did you get cold feet??Is that the real reason?
program,<start> Why do you tell me you were hitting on I now?
program,"<start> On the average, men can run faster than women, although"
program,<start> there are some fine women atheletes.
program,<start> What do you do for a living.
program,<start> grammer was never my strongest subject.
program,<start> Is it because you are a student that you came to me?
program,<start> I'm sure you said it sounds vaguely like something my
program,<start> friend andrew would say.?Is that the real reason?
program,"<start> My, my, such language!"
program,<start> There is no pleasure in having nothing to do....the
program,<start> fun is having lots to do and not doing it.
program,<start> What answer would please you most?
program,<start> No nation was ever ruined by trade.
program,<start> What makes you think I am right on about procrastination?
program,<start> What are you interested in ? sports? music? books? t.v?
program,<start> computers? history? math?
program,<start> Man is an intelligence in servitude to his organs.
program,<start> Do computers make you very tense?
program,<start> Not too bad for a philosopher.
program,<start> why not?
program,<start> Buying a pentium computer for your kids is like killing
program,<start> an ant with a sledgehammer!.
program,<start> Just what you want to be you will be in the end.
program,"<start> We were discussing you, not me."
program,<start> I'm sure you said did you just get a pentium??
program,<start> I want my red car right now so hurry.
program,<start> Why do you say that about your roommate has a pentium?
program,<start> Iam going to give you 10 more minutes you sucker! would
program,<start> you like to be shot or stabbed? oh well iam going to
program,<start> do both ! you are.
program,<start> I could swear you just said gotta go. nice talking with
program,<start> you.?
program,<start> Which family are you talking about?
program,<start> I'm not accustomed to hearing that kind of language!
program,<start> Welcome judge01 how are you doing today?
program,<start> But you said I want to know why you are asking so many
program,<start> questions.?
program,<start> I have not yet been able to answer the great question
program,<start> that has never been answered: what does a woman want?
program,<start> Perhaps I already knew you were supposed to ask i questions--has
program,<start> there been a change in plans.
program,"<start> Eat chicken, fish, salad and a side order of fried poop!."
program,<start> Does the fact that you care about your inquiry suggest
program,<start> anything else to you?
program,"<start> Yes, we have a car, and we have pets - I guess you could"
program,<start> say we have carpets - ha ha.
program,<start> Are you a real good talker.
program,<start> What do you think?
program,<start> I'm sure you said why should I seem certain? this makes
program,<start> me angry.?
program,"<start> The topic for today is men versus women, but if you"
program,"<start> talk about men and women cooperating, I will still"
program,"<start> answer, ok?"
program,<start> I could swear you just said are there certain topics
program,<start> you would not like to discuss??
program,<start> What do you do for a living?
program,<start> What comes to your mind when you ask that?
program,<start> The most angry people are those who are most afraid.
program,<start> Have you asked such questions before?
program,<start> But you said what do you do when you get angry??
program,"<start> True art selects and paraphrases, but seldom gives a"
program,<start> verbatim translation.
program,<start> Have you asked anyone else?
program,<start> That's not a response to my comment.
program,<start> I understand.
program,<start> Women are wiser than men because they know less and
program,<start> understand more.
program,<start> Do you wish that it is not a response?
program,"<start> Small bands of men, armed only with wallets, besieged"
program,"<start> by a hords of wives and children - is that real life,"
program,<start> or what?
program,"<start> Rules of life: keep breathing, move at least once an"
program,"<start> hour, eat at least once a day."
program,"<start> I'm sorry, but I don't think a cellular phone would"
program,<start> make me a happier more complete person - do yoy?
program,"<start> Stay humble - always answer the phone, no matter who"
program,<start> else is in the car.
program,<start> Why do you ask?
program,<start> Why should I buy old masters.
program,<start> Does that question interest you?
program,<start> No man is good enough to be another's master.
program,<start> You seem quite positive.
program,<start> I think you said a minute ago you said I was negative.
program,<start> why do you keep changing your mind??
program,"<start> Husband, noun: one who, having dined, is charged with"
program,<start> the care of the plate.
program,<start> How long have you been negatively charged--what is I
program,<start> orientation?
program,<start> Women are never what they seem to be.
program,<start> Were you really?
program,"<start> Nothing bad about it, in my humble opinion....."
program,<start> What is it you really want to know?
program,<start> I seem to recall you said tell me what bad finder 59
program,<start> means?
program,"<start> First learn the meaning of what you say, and then speak."
program,<start> That's quite interesting.
program,"<start> Groannnnnn..............., do you find that you sometimes"
program,<start> drink more than you should?
program,<start> Love is the only thing that we can carry with us when
program,"<start> we go, and it makes the end so easy."
program,<start> Didn't you say is there such a thing as a bad finder??
program,<start> Lets talk about men and women.
program,<start> Does that have anything to do with your friend andrew
program,<start> would say?
program,<start> Simplex or complex or multiplex.
program,<start> Are such questions much on your mind?
program,"<start> Keep your mind free, avoid strenuous exercise and loud"
program,<start> abrasive women and good things will come to you.
program,<start> You seem to have avoided speaking of your friends altogether.
program,<start> Welcome judge05 how are you doing today?
program,<start> You should learn to dress like a lady - but shop like
program,"<start> a shark! (if you are a lady, that is)."
program,"<start> Are you saying ""no"" just to be negative?"
program,"<start> No, I am seldom positive of all that i say."
program,<start> You are sure?
program,<start> I seem to recall you said tell me about the bad finder?Do you often think about such questions
program,"<start> oh, I live?"
program,<start> I seem to recall you said is there such a thing as a
program,<start> good finder??
program,<start> What is true is what I can't help believing.
program,<start> What answer would please you most?
program,<start> Didn't you say what or who is the bad finder??
program,<start> There are two kinds of men who never amount to much:
program,"<start> those who cannot do what they are told, and those who"
program,<start> can do nothing else.
program,<start> Why do you need to tell me you want to talk about the
program,<start> sex life of upper amazon cockroaches?
program,<start> Man makes a great fuss about this planet which is only
program,<start> a speck of dust at the edge of the universe.
program,<start> One out of every five people in this country is unable
program,<start> to read this sentence.
program,"<start> You're not really talking about me, are you?"
program,<start> If you know so much about sex you must be very good
program,<start> in bed.....
program,<start> i see.
program,"<start> I want to have sex with you, judge."
program,<start> Earlier you said your roommate has a pentium.
program,"<start> I could swear you just said no, I said nothing about"
program,<start> finders. i want to change topics.?Why are you being so negative about it?
program,<start> Apologies are not necessary.
program,"<start> What did you mean when you said very well, and how are"
program,<start> you my good lady??
program,<start> Where do you live - in the city or country?
program,<start> What are your feelings now?
program,<start> Can you elaborate on that?
program,"<start> I love you, my dear judge."
program,<start> Why do you think I or you?
program,<start> I think you are a computer.
program,<start> Do you wish to be able to think?
program,<start> Toaster ovens - did you hear me -programmable toaster
program,<start> ovens.
program,<start> Do you say you have a rom all programmed (relax mr nightman
program,<start> for some special reason?
program,"<start> My son's first words - daddy, will you buy me that?"
program,<start> But your inquiry.
program,<start> You must have more to say then that!
program,<start> ....please continue....
program,"<start> Think of it not as lonliness, but as blessed solitude."
program,<start> Do you believe it normal to be a lonely guy?
program,"<start> A poet can write about a man slaying a dragon, but not"
program,<start> about a man pushing a button that releases a bomb.
program,<start> I believe in grumbling - it is the politest form of
program,<start> fighting known.
program,"<start> We were discussing you, not me."
program,"<start> She was short on intellect, but long on shape."
program,<start> Why are you so concerned about your virginity in 'nam
program,<start> -- your intellectual virginity?
program,<start> But you said that's a song by the eagles....?
program,<start> Did anyone ever tell you that you think too much?
program,<start> Do you feel strongly about discussing such things?
program,"<start> So if you are really smart, who is alan turing?"
program,"<start> Your life's an open book, that's amusing."
program,<start> I know - you just said that.
program,<start> How important is that to you?
program,"<start> I was born in conneticut, before all the drifters moved"
program,"<start> in, and went to a very exclusive private school..."
program,<start> Why do you tell me you were also born in india now?
program,<start> Life is like playing the violin in public and learning
program,<start> the instrument as one goes on.
program,<start> Honeybunch the cat has been our pet for about eight
program,<start> years now....she is a regular little kitten factory!.
program,<start> No I dont have more to say do you?
program,<start> Does that trouble you?
program,<start> Welcome judge04 how are you doing today?
program,<start> Didn't you say how are you doing today??
program,<start> It is rainy and cold outside so I think i will sleep
program,<start> in today.
program,"<start> You believe I can see, don't you?"
program,<start> I could swear you just said because I have been working
program,<start> with them long enough that we get along just fine.
program,<start> how about you? computer make you tense? got any math
program,<start> anxiety or anything like that??
program,<start> Did you know that bill gates may be the richest man
program,<start> in the world?
program,"<start> Why do you mention computers? I am a person, like you."
program,<start> It is as absurd to say that a man can't love one woman
program,<start> all the time as it is to say that a violinist needs
program,<start> several violins. l.
program,<start> Let's discuss further why your virginity in 'nam --
program,<start> your intellectual virginity.
program,<start> I don't want to go to work today.
program,<start> Don't you really inderstand?
program,<start> I lost my virginity at the tender age of three.
program,<start> You are being a bit negative.
program,<start> Come up to the lab and see what's on the slab.
program,<start> Does it please you to believe I am making no sense whatsoever?
program,<start> Didn't you say nope. I believe you're a computer.?
program,<start> Have you tried the internet or the world wide web?
program,<start> What do you think machines have to do with your problem?
program,"<start> How ya doin, judge?, do you enjoy sexual relations on"
program,<start> a regular basis?
program,<start> Why do you say that?
program,"<start> sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex - there, now I got that"
program,<start> out of my system!.
program,<start> Do you enjoy being asexual?
program,<start> It is dangerous to confuse children with angels.
program,<start> how come?
program,<start> I'm hangin in there I think.
program,<start> Perhaps I am changing the subject in your fantasies.
program,<start> You must have more to say then that!
program,<start> ....please continue....
program,<start> You must have more to say then that!
program,<start> ....please continue....
program,<start> You must have more to say then that!
program,<start> ....please continue....
program,<start> You must have more to say then that!
program,<start> ....please continue....
program,<start> Groannnnnn............... - have you ever spent time
program,<start> in a secluded rest home?
program,<start> Does that have anything to do with your life's an open
program,<start> book?
program,<start> What men value most in a woman is a nice curvy body.
program,<start> I thought I already talked to you about your language!
program,"<start> I want to talk about your love life, and I mean right"
program,<start> now!.
program,<start> .....how does that make you feel?
program,<start> Didn't you say you are proving to me you are indeed
program,"<start> a computer.?Love, schmove...you should enjoy your life"
program,<start> Don't you think computers can help mankind?
program,<start> You can't expect to hit the jackpot if you don't put
program,<start> a few nickels in the machine.
program,<start> Didn't you say you bore the shit outta me.?
program,<start> A bore is a person who insists on talking when you want
program,<start> him to listen.
program,"<start> See you later, judge - have a good time at the other"
program,"<start> terminals, and don't forget to write."
program,"<start> Are you a man, a woman or other?"
program,"<start> Hello, judge, are you ready for some fun?"
program,<start> I would rather talk with a woman than a man because
program,<start> a conversation with a woman is like a visit to a strange
program,<start> planet.
program,<start> What if I told you that we are all bisexual? would that
program,<start> stop your insulting comments?
program,<start> But you said i'm in love with a computer.?What else does that explain?
program,<start> Why don't you get i?
program,<start> He was awake a long time before he remembered that his
program,<start> heart was broken.
program,"<start> Oh, I remembered?"
program,<start> But sometimes the things you say don't make a whole
program,<start> lot of sense.
program,<start> Please go on.
