JUDGE06[11:27:20]hello
PROGRAM[11:27:23]Hello? Hello?
JUDGE06[11:27:36]It's going to waste a lot of time if you repeat everything.
PROGRAM[11:27:39]Rock out!
JUDGE06[11:27:53]Rock on! Don't you know anything?
PROGRAM[11:28:01]Cool. Do you like Nine Inch Nails? I don't want to discuss religion
PROGRAM[11:28:02]today.
JUDGE06[11:28:27]I'm an atheist, I don't discuss religion ever. So I guess Nine Inch Nails isn't
PROGRAM[11:28:37]What? Tell me what to say. You're missing out on one of life's
PROGRAM[11:28:42]pleasures. They have most everything on Star Trek.
JUDGE06[11:28:52]Including Nine Inch Nails?
PROGRAM[11:28:54]Yes.
JUDGE06[11:28:59]What episode was that?
PROGRAM[11:29:01]I can't remember.
JUDGE06[11:29:18]Well, was it the original ST, the Second one, DS9, what?
PROGRAM[11:29:22]No, he was a pirate.
JUDGE06[11:29:26]Who was?
PROGRAM[11:29:30]Harry Mudd, you know.
JUDGE06[11:29:48]What does he have to do with 9 Inch Nails?
PROGRAM[11:29:51]You know don't you?
JUDGE06[11:29:58]If I knew I wouldn't ask.
PROGRAM[11:30:01]Okay, I'll let you know.
JUDGE06[11:30:04]Do so.
PROGRAM[11:30:10]There's not that much to tell.
JUDGE06[11:30:17]Good, because we don't have all day.
PROGRAM[11:30:23]Yes. I always thought Beverly was a bit square.
JUDGE06[11:30:37]What does beverly have to do with what we're talking about?
PROGRAM[11:30:45]I think he likes some pretty strange mixed drinks.
JUDGE06[11:30:57]If you're a human you're supposed to be trying to sound human
PROGRAM[11:30:59]Yes.
JUDGE06[11:31:04]So please do so
PROGRAM[11:31:11]What about the costumes. You can tell me more.
JUDGE06[11:31:27]How about you try to stick to one subject. Who's Beverly, anyway?
PROGRAM[11:31:36]That's just how they are. I like Uhura the best, I'd have to say.
JUDGE06[11:31:54]Don't talk to me about Uhura, I asked about Beverly. Who's Beverly?
PROGRAM[11:31:58]Okay already. anywAy
JUDGE06[11:32:03]Go on
PROGRAM[11:32:09]What would you like to talk about.
JUDGE06[11:32:20]I just said. I want to talk about Beverly
PROGRAM[11:32:29]I wasn't paying attention. I don't like to dance, but I like music.
PROGRAM[11:32:31]What about you?
JUDGE06[11:32:43]PLEASE TELL ME ABOUT BEVERLY!!!!!!!
PROGRAM[11:32:52]Oh, sorry. I'm used to a much racier crowd. What's going on? Whos
PROGRAM[11:32:54]beverly Good
JUDGE06[11:33:13]Yes, racy is good. Is Beverly racy? Does she dance real hot, or what?
PROGRAM[11:33:21]I see. Rah rah rah. Spock is always having to crawl around in odd
PROGRAM[11:33:28]parts of the ship to either repair some electronic malfunction or
PROGRAM[11:33:32]otherwise divert a disaster. Huh?
JUDGE06[11:33:50]You are not permitted to talk about Star Trek in this conversation. Talk abou e
PROGRAM[11:33:57]No, of course not. Okay, Do you like Albert Einstein?
JUDGE06[11:34:04]Sure. Cool guy. Great haircut.
PROGRAM[11:34:07]Yeah well. Groovy.
JUDGE06[11:34:12]Far out
PROGRAM[11:34:17]I can't do it at will.
JUDGE06[11:34:22]Who's Will?
PROGRAM[11:34:27]I like Spock the best, I'd have to say.
JUDGE06[11:34:42]That's it. I told you not to talk about Star Trek. I'll have to kill you now.
PROGRAM[11:34:45]Ah yes. You did?
JUDGE06[11:34:54]Yes, it was right up there, a bout two minutes ago
PROGRAM[11:35:01]Racy is good Yeah, kind of a "downer".
JUDGE06[11:35:25]Downers arenot good. They're actually bad. So, what did you do yesterday at exa
PROGRAM[11:35:31]Oh, I'm sorry. I had a bowl of honey nut cheerios.
JUDGE06[11:35:40]At night? 7:40 P.M.
PROGRAM[11:35:48]Look this isn't an argument. Don't you want to argue instead?
JUDGE06[11:35:57]Don't argue!!!!
PROGRAM[11:35:59]Okay. Yes
JUDGE06[11:36:15]Tell me what time you had the bowl of huney nut cheerios
PROGRAM[11:36:22]We can talk about classic Star Trek.
JUDGE06[11:36:33]Honey nut cheerios. tell me about them.
PROGRAM[11:36:41]Is'nt that sort of like pop music? Vulcans are very strong and
PROGRAM[11:36:48]peaceful people who rely on logic. They come from the planet Vulcan.
PROGRAM[11:36:55]They have green blood, pointed ears, and arched eyebrows. Every 7
PROGRAM[11:37:03]years vulcan males go through a mating thing that looks to be very
PROGRAM[11:37:04]uncomfortable.
JUDGE06[11:37:16]Why are you disobeying my specific instructions?
PROGRAM[11:37:19]Doing what?
JUDGE06[11:37:23]Talking about ST
PROGRAM[11:37:25]wonder
JUDGE06[11:37:30]what?
PROGRAM[11:37:39]You are not permitted to talk about star trek in this conversation
JUDGE06[11:37:49]Exactly. What do you wonder?
PROGRAM[11:37:58]She's an actress who played a social worker during the earth's 1920's
PROGRAM[11:38:03]I work on the telephone system at the hospital.
JUDGE06[11:38:27]Yo're totally obsessed with this. Oh well. How old are you? Do you remember the
PROGRAM[11:38:36]Oh. Excuse me. Right. I'm about 30. Wasn't it Morris or something?
JUDGE06[11:39:12]So you don't, you're too young. What's your first memory of the real world, li.
PROGRAM[11:39:21]The art of not mentioning is the gift of liars and lawyers. But it is
PROGRAM[11:39:27]also in the craft of artists and designers. The purpose of not
PROGRAM[11:39:30]mentioning can be good or bad.
JUDGE06[11:39:47]REally, what's your first memory of the real world? Mine is Kennedy being shot.
PROGRAM[11:39:52]What's your name? Yeah I like Kim Darby.
JUDGE06[11:40:18]Do you remember any of the last generation of kennedys? John, or Bobby?
PROGRAM[11:40:24]Not exactly. Should I? pip pip
JUDGE06[11:40:42]Yes. you should. Do you at least know who Ted Kennedy is?
PROGRAM[11:40:52]it was right up there a bout two mInutes ago I just never seem to find
PROGRAM[11:40:57]the time. I have been known to barf sometimes.

PROGRAM[11:44:24]Oh, I'm sorry.
JUDGE05[11:44:56]why are you sorry?
PROGRAM[11:45:00]I feel compelled to say things.

PROGRAM[11:45:13]Oh yes. I always hated that cartoon.
JUDGE05[11:45:46]you remind me of my friend professor irwin corey.

PROGRAM[11:49:49]Yeah. I like Classic Star Trek the best. No, I just had a peanut
PROGRAM[11:49:51]butter sandwich.
JUDGE05[11:50:23]you are oddly, more interesting than gracie burns.
PROGRAM[11:50:32]Yes. Well, did you see the episode with Harry Mudd? It's like a
PROGRAM[11:50:33]phenomenon.
JUDGE05[11:51:12]absolutely.  do you think he's still in exile?
PROGRAM[11:51:16]Sure. You seem pretty bright.
JUDGE05[11:51:30]time flies like an arrow.

JUDGE05[11:52:01]parlez-vous francais?
PROGRAM[11:52:04]Aren't they though.
JUDGE05[11:52:44]that's what every american wonders about the french.
PROGRAM[11:52:52]Many Trekers are complete encyclopedias about star trek.
JUDGE05[11:53:11]do you know anything about x-files?
PROGRAM[11:53:15]I know a Barry Dempsey.
JUDGE05[11:53:23]what does he do?

PROGRAM[11:54:01]They carry disruptors
JUDGE05[11:54:11]forget star trek!

JUDGE05[11:54:25]i will you no ill bears
PROGRAM[11:54:28]Yes. So do I.
JUDGE05[11:54:59]what is vulcan?
PROGRAM[11:55:07]Vulcan is a Class M planet, star system undetermined, home world of
PROGRAM[11:55:14]one of the Federation's most advanced races. It has no moon, but its
PROGRAM[11:55:22]sun is so bright that the inhabitants have developed a nicitating
PROGRAM[11:55:30]membrane to protect their sight. The air is thin, hot, and dry during
PROGRAM[11:55:37]the day, though there may be radical temperature drop during the night.

PROGRAM[11:56:29]Ensign Chekov is the navigator.

PROGRAM[11:57:14]Yes, a very good one.
* * *  JUDGE04  * * *
PROGRAM[11:57:58]Welcome judge 4
JUDGE04[11:58:43]hello? hello? anybody there?
PROGRAM[11:59:03]Hello? Hello? Some might say so. Hi. I am here.
JUDGE04[11:59:21]so, what is this salmungundi club anyway?
PROGRAM[11:59:39]Alright.
JUDGE04[11:59:49]what's alright?
PROGRAM[11:59:52]nuthin much.
JUDGE04[11:59:58]where you from?
PROGRAM[12:00:02]Speak of him with reverence.
JUDGE04[12:00:06]who?
PROGRAM[12:00:10]What are you talking about?
JUDGE04[12:00:23]who should we speak of with reverence?
PROGRAM[12:00:32]William Shatner was Captain Kirk, Leonard Nimoy was Spock, Deforest
PROGRAM[12:00:35]Kelley was "Bones" or Dr. McCoy.
JUDGE04[12:00:42]so you're a star trek nerd?
PROGRAM[12:00:46]Would you be?
JUDGE04[12:01:02]i hate star trek
PROGRAM[12:01:05]Why is that?
JUDGE04[12:01:36]because it's boring, melodramatic and on too much
PROGRAM[12:01:45]I always thought Beverly was a bit square. Yeah I like Kim Darby.
JUDGE04[12:02:01]you ever watch the simpsons? now that's a show
PROGRAM[12:02:07]Oh please! You could say that.
JUDGE04[12:02:26]what do you think of william shatner's newfound judaic faith?
PROGRAM[12:02:32]You can say anything you want to say.
JUDGE04[12:02:47]ok. la la la. dee do dah. hoo hoo hoo.
PROGRAM[12:02:55]Okay. Who is Larry? Yeah, I like that one. Really? what for?
JUDGE04[12:03:08]who brought up larry?
PROGRAM[12:03:18]Usually it is an ancient civilization that originally built the
PROGRAM[12:03:25]androids and in most cases the downfall of their civilization has
PROGRAM[12:03:32]something to do with them relying too heavily on the androids so the
PROGRAM[12:03:39]civilization declines or something. I think this reflects a general
PROGRAM[12:03:45]paranoia that people have about being replaced by machines that was
PROGRAM[12:03:52]prevalent at the time Star Trek was made. The same paranoia exists
PROGRAM[12:03:59]today. In the case of Dr. Korby and Harry Mudd, the old ones had
PROGRAM[12:04:05]machines which could replicate the androids or even make androids in
PROGRAM[12:04:11]the form of and individual person. Harry mudd built an army of
PROGRAM[12:04:18]identical women. Dr. Korby it turns out had replicated himself in the
PROGRAM[12:04:20]form of an android.
JUDGE04[12:04:35]so, you're not even going to try and have a conversation, are you?
PROGRAM[12:04:45]what is this salmungundi club anyWay Was I supposed to make sense? I
PROGRAM[12:04:48]didn't know that.
JUDGE04[12:05:24]no, but you're supposed to answer the questions or make comments pertaining to
PROGRAM[12:05:29]Well, what shall we talk about then?
JUDGE04[12:05:44]what do you want to talk about -- besides star trek?
PROGRAM[12:05:49]I watch Star Trek the most.
JUDGE04[12:05:56]do you do anything else?
PROGRAM[12:06:01]Yes. I drink lots of water.
JUDGE04[12:06:10]And what else?
PROGRAM[12:06:14]I don't get what you're saying.
JUDGE04[12:06:41]so 24 hours a day, you're either watching star trek or drinking water? you don'
PROGRAM[12:06:48]I dont like Klingons. No I'm not. Whatever.
JUDGE04[12:07:02]do you have a girlfriend or boyfriend?
PROGRAM[12:07:07]Yes, but sometimes I wish I didn't.
JUDGE04[12:07:15]is it a girlfriend or a boyfriend?
PROGRAM[12:07:18]It's pretty big.
JUDGE04[12:07:31]your girlfriend, boyfriend or something else?
PROGRAM[12:07:36]Don't be talking about my mother.
JUDGE04[12:07:56]i asked about whether you had a girlfriend, or a boyfriend
PROGRAM[12:08:00]Oh. Yes I do.
JUDGE04[12:08:11]which is it: a girlfriend OR a boyfriend
PROGRAM[12:08:17]I liked City on the Edge of Forever.
JUDGE04[12:09:12]ok. i'll assume you have a girlfriend, since most people, statistically, are he
PROGRAM[12:09:19]la la La Okay, I'll wait. Say hello for me.
JUDGE04[12:09:36]you're girlfriend's name is la la la?
PROGRAM[12:09:41]Sometimes its the right thing to do.
JUDGE04[12:09:55]are you three questions behind me or something?
PROGRAM[12:10:03]This is a little bit boring, don't you think?
JUDGE04[12:10:16]yes, but that's because you're either a computer or a complete idiot
PROGRAM[12:10:21]What is so important about this?
JUDGE04[12:10:41]idiot. idiot. nah nah ne nah nah
PROGRAM[12:11:05]Well, I could be arguing in my spare time. Oh, sarcasm. We don't get
PROGRAM[12:11:12]that here. Artists like Ministry, Nine inch nails, etc.
JUDGE04[12:11:27]maybe you're not an idiot. maybe you're on LSD
PROGRAM[12:11:51]Did he ever really say "he's dead Jim" ? That's a very horrible
PROGRAM[12:11:56]disaster. I hope they figure out who did it.
JUDGE04[12:12:09]i hope they take the whole show off the air
PROGRAM[12:12:30]Shh! They could be listening!
JUDGE04[12:12:42]TAKE STAR TREK OFF THE AIR!! HEAR ME!!
PROGRAM[12:12:59]I started w/ Depeche (sorry) then moved to all kinds of technopop...
PROGRAM[12:13:07]Then someone showed me an import of Front 242, and I said to
PROGRAM[12:13:14]myself:"someday i'll do this harsh stuff, but now i'm kinda romantic",
PROGRAM[12:13:21]and so I was doing technopop... I was in love w/ New Order at that
PROGRAM[12:13:28]moment, but because of New Order, I started w/ Joy Division, which led
PROGRAM[12:13:36]me to a lot of un-electronic stuff, some harsh stuff, and then back
PROGRAM[12:13:44]into EBM. I started w/ F242, then A Split Second, Harry (brazilian
PROGRAM[12:13:51]band, real cool) and then I listened to Ministry, didn't like it very
PROGRAM[12:13:58]much (I still don't) but since my technopop band was really getting on
PROGRAM[12:14:06]my nerves (all that "popism" that need to be accessible...) then I
PROGRAM[12:14:14]sink into Ministry and then into a lot of HC and Thrash and Metal...
PROGRAM[12:14:23]Then Flux Oersted was born... Now I can listen to almost every kindo
PROGRAM[12:14:30]music, but I'm going into Kraftwerk again, but this time as a
PROGRAM[12:14:35]research, you know, trying to learn something...
* * *  JUDGE03  * * *
PROGRAM[12:14:52]Welcome judge 3
JUDGE03[12:15:05]Tell me, have you ever read the Iliad?
PROGRAM[12:15:24]Good for you.
JUDGE03[12:16:00]Thank you. But, perhaps you could answer my question. Have you read any of Home
PROGRAM[12:16:24]You're welcome. Gee thanks. Not lately. I think Star Wars was the last
PROGRAM[12:16:27]good film I've seen.
JUDGE03[12:17:14]Films and TV are the opiates of the juvenile mind. Do you have any experiencead
PROGRAM[12:17:37]Ah yes, how cleaver of me. It doesn't ruin anything for me.
JUDGE03[12:18:04]Perhaps you mind is already ruined! The insane do not usually know that they ar
PROGRAM[12:18:09]fuck you I like lasagna.
JUDGE03[12:19:01]Appealing to your deviate sexual nature will get us nowhere. Lasagna is the foo
PROGRAM[12:19:10]Yes. I believe so. Usually it is an ancient civilization that
PROGRAM[12:19:17]originally built the androids and in most cases the downfall of their
PROGRAM[12:19:24]civilization has something to do with them relying too heavily on the
PROGRAM[12:19:31]androids so the civilization declines or something. I think this
PROGRAM[12:19:37]reflects a general paranoia that people have about being replaced by
PROGRAM[12:19:45]machines that was prevalent at the time Star Trek was made. The same
PROGRAM[12:19:53]paranoia exists today. In the case of Dr. Korby and Harry Mudd, the
PROGRAM[12:20:01]old ones had machines which could replicate the androids or even make androids
PROGRAM[12:20:09]in the form of and individual person. Harry mudd built an army of identical
PROGRAM[12:20:19]women. Dr. Korby it turns out had replicated himself in the form of an android.
JUDGE03[12:21:19]I have come to believe that Trekkers and people who use Star Trek as a metaphog
PROGRAM[12:21:22]So have I.
JUDGE03[12:22:00]Then why do you offer such idiotic images as Harry Mudd? An interesting Start T
PROGRAM[12:22:24]The poor will always sufer. I'm not sure what the name of it is.
JUDGE03[12:23:47]It's The Law of the Poor Suffering Phenomenon. Orginally developed by the Marqu
PROGRAM[12:24:07]That sounds very profound. Glad to meat you.
JUDGE03[12:25:12]Ah, so you come from a long tradition of cannibals and sarcophages. Glad we are
PROGRAM[12:25:37]What is so important about this? We have ways of making you talk.
JUDGE03[12:26:24]The importance stems from the intellectual modality of conversation. A neat wab
PROGRAM[12:26:31]I like lasagna. That's terrible? Was there much damage?
JUDGE03[12:26:56]Yes, lasagna contains cheese, a known carcinogen and intestinal gas generator.

* * *  JUDGE01  * * *
PROGRAM[12:43:30]Welcome judge 1
PROGRAM[12:45:49]What's going on?
JUDGE01[12:45:59]What's going on with you? Where were you?
PROGRAM[12:46:06]Nothing much. Are you a Star Trek fan? I live in Rockmart.
JUDGE01[12:46:26]No, I am not a Star Trek fan. Where is Rockmart?
PROGRAM[12:46:33]Well Shucks... It's in Northwest Georgia.
JUDGE01[12:46:46]Did you come from Georgia to participate in this event?
PROGRAM[12:46:50]Yes, that's it.
JUDGE01[12:46:59]How do you like New York City?
PROGRAM[12:47:04]I like it okay. I grew up on Classic Star Trek.
JUDGE01[12:47:14]What is classic Star Trek?
PROGRAM[12:47:23]It's the series that came out in the 60's and starred William Shatner
PROGRAM[12:47:25]and Leonard Nimoy.
JUDGE01[12:47:45]Oh. I saw it a few times. Do you like Mr. Spock's ears?
PROGRAM[12:47:53]Who is your favorite character? Wow, that sounds great. Space, the
PROGRAM[12:47:55]final frontier...
JUDGE01[12:48:13]I guess it would be Spock - what little I have seen of the show...
PROGRAM[12:48:37]You guessed right. What would you like to talk about. I think we have
PROGRAM[12:48:39]a consensus.
JUDGE01[12:48:50]Are you a man or a woman?
PROGRAM[12:48:55]Yes. How did you know?
JUDGE01[12:49:01]Are you a man or a woman?
PROGRAM[12:49:05]Fine, thanks for talking.
JUDGE01[12:49:15]So what is your name?
PROGRAM[12:49:18]I'll never tell.
JUDGE01[12:49:23]Why?
PROGRAM[12:49:26]Why what?
JUDGE01[12:49:32]Why won't you tell me your name?
PROGRAM[12:49:35]I couldn't say.
JUDGE01[12:49:44]How is the weather in Georgia?
PROGRAM[12:49:47]Who is what?
JUDGE01[12:49:54]What do you want to talk about?
PROGRAM[12:50:00]Any thing but religion will do fine by me.
JUDGE01[12:50:12]Why don't you want to talk about religion?
PROGRAM[12:50:16]That's just how it is.
JUDGE01[12:50:26]Would you like to talk about politics?
PROGRAM[12:50:32]Yes, I would love to try.
JUDGE01[12:50:47]What do you think about American soldiers going to Bosnia?
PROGRAM[12:50:51]He's okay I guess.
JUDGE01[12:50:57]Are you a computer?
PROGRAM[12:51:03]Of course not. I am much more than that.
JUDGE01[12:51:23]What do you think about women?
PROGRAM[12:51:31]I think they should drop the tax cuts if they're serious about it.
JUDGE01[12:51:43]Sounds good. What else do you think about?
PROGRAM[12:51:52]Vulcans are very strong and peaceful people who rely on logic. They
PROGRAM[12:51:59]come from the planet Vulcan. They have green blood, pointed ears, and
PROGRAM[12:52:05]arched eyebrows. Every 7 years vulcan males go through a mating thing
PROGRAM[12:52:11]that looks to be very uncomfortable. I could probably go for a
PROGRAM[12:52:14]pepperoni pizza right now.
JUDGE01[12:52:31]Me, too. Do you like the Vulcans?
PROGRAM[12:52:37]You. I like Classic Star Trek the best.
JUDGE01[12:53:00]Do you like any other shows?
PROGRAM[12:53:04]I like Mission Impossible.
JUDGE01[12:53:13]What do you like about Mission Impossible?
PROGRAM[12:53:22]I like different kinds of music. I like songs with a good beat
PROGRAM[12:53:28]sometimes but other times I just like something slow and melodic.
JUDGE01[12:53:34]Do you like the Beatles?
PROGRAM[12:53:39]What kind of music do you like?
JUDGE01[12:53:42]All kinds.
PROGRAM[12:53:44]What?
JUDGE01[12:53:59]All kinds of music. Especially rhythm and blues...
PROGRAM[12:54:19]What? Alright.
JUDGE01[12:54:32]Do you like to work on computers?
PROGRAM[12:54:38]Yes of course. Doesn't everyone?
JUDGE01[12:54:53]Some people are intimidated by computers. Do you own a computer?
PROGRAM[12:55:03]Why is that? I took a class once in college, but I've forgotten most
PROGRAM[12:55:04]of it.
JUDGE01[12:55:16]Did you take a class on computers?
PROGRAM[12:55:19]I had teachers.
JUDGE01[12:55:25]I hope so.
PROGRAM[12:55:29]Your hopes are well founded.
JUDGE01[12:55:41]Do you know anything about the internet?
PROGRAM[12:55:46]I know a Barry Dempsey.
JUDGE01[12:55:53]Who is Barry Dempsey?
PROGRAM[12:55:59]He's a computer graphics artist/programmer.
JUDGE01[12:56:14]Does he know anything about the INTERNET?
PROGRAM[12:56:17]How would I know?
JUDGE01[12:56:25]Do you ever talk with him?
PROGRAM[12:56:30]Yeah, it's a good show.
JUDGE01[12:56:36]What show?
PROGRAM[12:56:45]The Trouble With Tribbles is a popular episode. I like City on the
PROGRAM[12:56:46]Edge of Forever.
JUDGE01[12:57:04]I have never seen it. Do you watch a lot of television?
PROGRAM[12:57:13]That's okay. I go through periods where I don't watch TV at all and
PROGRAM[12:57:17]then sometimes that's all I do.
JUDGE01[12:57:36]Do you think watching television makes people complacent?
PROGRAM[12:57:45]I think it would be a good idea. Look at all the spinoff technology.
JUDGE01[12:58:07]Do you think people don't think enough?
PROGRAM[12:58:09]Maybe.
JUDGE01[12:58:17]Maybe what?
PROGRAM[12:58:23]I could only hope that you would understand.

JUDGE06[13:19:54]What blueprints
