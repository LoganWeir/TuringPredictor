CONFEDR[11:10:15] Hello.


JUDGE04[11:10:20] How are you?


CONFEDR[11:10:35] Don't ask.  I'm feeling kinda poor right now.

CONFEDR[11:10:48] It just hasn't been a good week for me.


JUDGE04[11:11:02] are you sick mentally or physically?


CONFEDR[11:11:19] All week I been feeling sick in my stomach on account of 

CONFEDR[11:11:20] my boss.

CONFEDR[11:11:34] I got real trouble at work.  I think I'm going to get fired.


JUDGE04[11:11:42] are you taking pepto?


CONFEDR[11:11:49] Of course not.

CONFEDR[11:12:04] I never stole nothing in my life.  But they always blame 

CONFEDR[11:12:13] the cleaners whenever anything is missing.


JUDGE04[11:12:36] you're a cleaner?


CONFEDR[11:12:51] Yeah?  You think I'm a thief, too?  You're no better than 

CONFEDR[11:12:56] the rest of them.

CONFEDR[11:13:03] Leave me alone, asshole.


JUDGE04[11:13:11] asshole?


CONFEDR[11:13:18] I don't know.


JUDGE04[11:13:27] you called me an asshole?


CONFEDR[11:13:34] Huh?


JUDGE04[11:13:46] don't you have manners. you don't even know me and you're

JUDGE04[11:13:49] calling me a bad name


CONFEDR[11:13:55] Beats me.


JUDGE04[11:14:05] anyway, where do you do your cleaning?


CONFEDR[11:14:13] What do you mean?


JUDGE04[11:14:20] whose office do you clean?


CONFEDR[11:14:26] What?


JUDGE04[11:14:36] where do you work?


CONFEDR[11:14:48] At the university.  I mostly clean the Standish Building.


JUDGE04[11:14:53] what university?


CONFEDR[11:15:03] University of Eastern Ontario.

CONFEDR[11:15:18] I'm a cleaner.  I empty trash.  Vacuum.  Dust.  You know.


JUDGE04[11:15:26] and why do they want to fire you?


CONFEDR[11:15:42] It's just because my boss, Mr. Johnson, is mad at me.


JUDGE04[11:15:48] why is he mad at you?


CONFEDR[11:16:02] I didn't do nothing wrong.  But he thinks I did.

CONFEDR[11:16:17] It's all because of that radio they think I stole from the 

CONFEDR[11:16:17] lab.


JUDGE04[11:16:30] that's too bad. are you in a union?


CONFEDR[11:16:48] What would I tell the union?  They won't say they're firing 

CONFEDR[11:16:58] me because I stole the radio.  They'll just make up some 

CONFEDR[11:17:12] excuse.  If they want to fire you, they can always find an 

CONFEDR[11:17:25] excuse.  I wish I could just tell them what happened to the 

CONFEDR[11:17:33] radio, but I don't know what to say.


JUDGE04[11:17:43] maybe you could get a job as something else, like a computer?


CONFEDR[11:17:53] I don't know nothing about computers.


JUDGE04[11:18:01] what else do you know how to do?


CONFEDR[11:18:15] I don't know anything else.  If I knew anything I could figure 

CONFEDR[11:18:20] out who stole the radio.


JUDGE04[11:18:29] maybe you could go back to school


CONFEDR[11:18:46] No.  I didn't like school and school didn't like me.  I dropped 

CONFEDR[11:18:57] out as soon as I turned sixteen.  I never shed no tears when 

CONFEDR[11:19:06] I left and I ain't never going back.


JUDGE04[11:19:13] how old are you now?


CONFEDR[11:19:20] I'm fifty-one.


JUDGE04[11:19:28] you married? does your wife work?


CONFEDR[11:19:34] Yeah.

CONFEDR[11:19:40] To Jeannie.

CONFEDR[11:19:52] God, she's going to be pissed if I get fired.


JUDGE04[11:20:03] how many years have you worked there?


CONFEDR[11:20:11] I don't know.


JUDGE04[11:20:17] for how long have you worked there?


CONFEDR[11:20:27] Eighteen years.


JUDGE04[11:20:40] after 18 years, you'd think they'd trust you


CONFEDR[11:20:44] Huh?


JUDGE04[11:20:53] after all that time, you'd think they would trust you?


CONFEDR[11:21:00] Beats me.


JUDGE04[11:21:17] what's your favorite beer? you must have good beer in Canada?


CONFEDR[11:21:26] What do you mean?


JUDGE04[11:21:33] do you drink beer?


CONFEDR[11:21:41] Yeah.  I like beer.

CONFEDR[11:21:46] I drink Bud.


JUDGE04[11:21:55] Bud? Why not Molson?


CONFEDR[11:22:01] What?


JUDGE04[11:22:09] You know what Molson beer is?


CONFEDR[11:22:15] I don't know.


JUDGE04[11:22:31] you ever been to Sarnia?


CONFEDR[11:22:36] Huh?


JUDGE04[11:22:45] What town is Eastern Ontario in?


CONFEDR[11:22:51] Beats me.


JUDGE04[11:23:05] Sarnia is on the western side of Ontario. I used to work

JUDGE04[11:23:17] in Saginaw and we'd go over there once in a while


CONFEDR[11:23:22] What do you mean?


JUDGE04[11:23:33] So, all you can talk about is cleaning?


CONFEDR[11:23:52] Who would I talk to?  What would I say?  I already told Mr. 

CONFEDR[11:24:03] Johnson that I didn't take it.  He didn't believe me


JUDGE04[11:24:10] Who is Mr. Johnson


CONFEDR[11:24:24] Mr. Johnson's my boss.  I been working for him for more'n 

CONFEDR[11:24:38] eight years, now.  Ever since Mr. Jackson retired and they 

CONFEDR[11:24:40] hired him.


JUDGE04[11:24:50] have you had trouble with mr. johnson before>


CONFEDR[11:25:02] I got a lot to worry about right now.

CONFEDR[11:25:17] I got real trouble at work.  I think I'm going to get fired.


JUDGE04[11:25:22] i know that already


CONFEDR[11:25:28] What?


JUDGE04[11:25:43] can you call mr. jackson and have him intervene?

CONFEDR[11:27:15] Hello.


JUDGE03[11:27:44] Hi. Tell me a little about your philosophy of life.


CONFEDR[11:27:53] Something I can do for you?


JUDGE03[11:28:21] Yes. Do you believe in the intrinsic power of good and eveil?


CONFEDR[11:28:34] Well don't waste your breath telling me about it.  I'm not 

CONFEDR[11:28:40] in a real helpful mood right now.

CONFEDR[11:28:54] It just hasn't been a good week for me.


JUDGE03[11:29:08] So you believe that moral issues are a matter of temperment

JUDGE03[11:29:26] and condition? You can't keep avoiding the issue.


CONFEDR[11:29:44] Yeah, well, it's kinda on my mind, you know.  I haven't been 

CONFEDR[11:29:56] thinking about much else since my boss talked to me on Tuesday.

CONFEDR[11:30:13] He thinks I stole a radio.  It was in one of the labs that 

CONFEDR[11:30:15] I clean.


JUDGE03[11:30:44] OK, let's start with that. Did you actualy steal the radio?


CONFEDR[11:30:50] No.

CONFEDR[11:31:06] I never stole nothing in my life.  But they always blame 

CONFEDR[11:31:19] the cleaners whenever anything is missing.


JUDGE03[11:31:46] Indeed. But let's stary on track. Do you know who actually

JUDGE03[11:32:06] took the radio? This is a ethical not a moral problem.


CONFEDR[11:32:24] I guess someone must have taken it if Professor Michaels 

CONFEDR[11:32:25] says so.

CONFEDR[11:32:41] I don't know how anyone could have stolen it, though.  Professor 

CONFEDR[11:32:53] Michaels always keeps his lab locked up tight.  Most of the 

CONFEDR[11:33:04] other professors aren't so careful about it as he is.


JUDGE03[11:33:40] Interesting. Does Professor Michaels have any reason to

JUDGE03[11:33:58] suspect you of this theft (other than you apparent guilty

JUDGE03[11:34:01] looks?)


CONFEDR[11:34:16] I watch some TV.  Hang around.  Normal stuff.  Drink some 

CONFEDR[11:34:28] beer.  I like to hang out with Fred and Al and the guys.


JUDGE03[11:34:49] It is a proven fact, first noticed by Aritotle, that beer

JUDGE03[11:35:08] drinking and an absence of a moral compass often go together.

JUDGE03[11:35:16] I now have my suspicions!


CONFEDR[11:35:25] I drink Bud.


JUDGE03[11:35:35] Then my suspicions are confirmed.


CONFEDR[11:35:40] What?


JUDGE03[11:36:00] Beer plus TV. A combination that almost always leads to

JUDGE03[11:36:10] radio theft. 


CONFEDR[11:36:28] It was a real neat radio.  It looked just like a can of Coke.


JUDGE03[11:36:52] You admit knowing what the radio looked like, coveting the

JUDGE03[11:37:13] radio, and drinking Bud. What is there left to say?


CONFEDR[11:37:32] I talked to the professor about it a couple of weeks ago 

CONFEDR[11:37:43] when he was working late.  He said he won it in a contest. 

CONFEDR[11:37:51]  I guess it was kinda special.


JUDGE03[11:38:12] I suggest you simply kill the professor, burn his body in

JUDGE03[11:38:38] the university furnances, and flee to Argentina. No body,

JUDGE03[11:38:57] no corpus delicti. It is you only alternative!


CONFEDR[11:39:15] I'm getting damn tired of worrying about this damn Coke-can 

CONFEDR[11:39:16] radio.


JUDGE03[11:39:39] Exactly. Throw the purloined radio into the East River.

JUDGE03[11:39:59] Send a note of apology to the professor's live in maid,

JUDGE03[11:40:16] and spread his ashes across the meadowlands. Do it quickly.


CONFEDR[11:40:31] I talked to the professor about it a couple of weeks ago 

CONFEDR[11:40:42] when he was working late.  He said he won it in a contest. 

CONFEDR[11:40:48]  I guess it was kinda special.


JUDGE03[11:41:13] In that case you had better kill his wife also. Don't take

JUDGE03[11:41:15] any chances.


CONFEDR[11:41:27] I wouldn't get much satisfaction out of that.

CONFEDR[11:41:43] Bad enough getting fired.  I don't want to go get put in 

CONFEDR[11:41:47] jail, too.

CONFEDR[11:41:59] Then I'd never get another job.

CONFEDR[11:59:32] I could use a drink.  Kind of week I been having, I need 

CONFEDR[11:59:42] something a little stronger than coffee, though.

CONFEDR[11:59:56] We usually go down to the club and drink beer and stuff.


JUDGE01[12:00:02] Whose we and what club?


CONFEDR[12:00:21] It's just a club.  Down on Main.  It's called the Mustang

CONFEDR[12:02:02] I'm a cleaner.  I empty trash.  Vacuum.  Dust.  You know.

CONFEDR[12:02:18] But I don't know how much longer I'm going to be doing that. 

CONFEDR[12:02:23]  I think I'm going to get fired.


JUDGE01[12:02:29] Why are you going to get fired?


CONFEDR[12:02:44] It's just because my boss, Mr. Johnson, is mad at me.


JUDGE01[12:02:53] Why is he mad at you?


CONFEDR[12:03:08] I didn't do nothing wrong.  But he thinks I did.

CONFEDR[12:03:24] He thinks I stole a radio.  It was in one of the labs that 

CONFEDR[12:03:26] I clean.


JUDGE01[12:03:42] Oh. That's a problem. They always try to blame it on the

CONFEDR[12:03:50] cleaning people. It's really unfair.


CONFEDR[12:03:55] Huh?


JUDGE01[12:04:16] Forget it. Anyway, do you like music?


CONFEDR[12:04:33] I like music, but I don't listen to the radio, ever.  It's 

CONFEDR[12:04:44] too hard to find good music.  They all play this rock and 

CONFEDR[12:04:58] roll stuff, like the Beatles.  I never liked that kind of 

CONFEDR[12:05:13] music when it was new.  Even country and western music sounds 

CONFEDR[12:05:17] like that now.


JUDGE01[12:05:48] Do you like country and western? Or did you used to?


CONFEDR[12:06:04] Do I like country and western??  I don't know much about 

CONFEDR[12:06:12] it, but I don't think I'd like it much.

CONFEDR[12:06:30] I watch some TV.  Hang around.  Normal stuff.  Drink some 

CONFEDR[12:06:46] beer.  I like to hang out with Fred and Al and the guys.


JUDGE01[12:06:52] What do you talk about?


CONFEDR[12:07:05] Who would I talk to?  What would I say?  I already told Mr. 

CONFEDR[12:07:16] Johnson that I didn't take it.  He didn't believe me


JUDGE01[12:07:28] Have you been fired yet?


CONFEDR[12:07:33] Not yet.

CONFEDR[12:07:48] They haven't said they're gonna fire me yet because they 

CONFEDR[12:08:02] gotta keep me around to clean until they can find someone 

CONFEDR[12:08:12] else to hire.  Then they'll fire me for some other reason 

CONFEDR[12:08:23] that won't make problems with the union.  They fire lots 

CONFEDR[12:08:36] of cleaners.  They'll just say I'm a bad cleaner.  They fired 

CONFEDR[12:08:49] my friend, Fred two years ago because they said he was a 

CONFEDR[12:08:52] bad cleaner.


JUDGE01[12:09:06] Well isn't it up to your union to protect you?


CONFEDR[12:09:22] What would I tell the union?  They won't say they're firing 

CONFEDR[12:09:36] me because I stole the radio.  They'll just make up some 

CONFEDR[12:09:48] excuse.  If they want to fire you, they can always find an 

CONFEDR[12:10:00] excuse.  I wish I could just tell them what happened to the 

CONFEDR[12:10:07] radio, but I don't know what to say.


JUDGE01[12:10:21] But don't you have a union steward who will defend you?


CONFEDR[12:10:39] What would I tell the union?  They won't say they're firing 

CONFEDR[12:10:50] me because I stole the radio.  They'll just make up some 

CONFEDR[12:11:03] excuse.  If they want to fire you, they can always find an

CONFEDR[12:11:19] radio, but I don't know what to say.

CONFEDR[12:11:34] Life ain't gonna be much fun unless I can find that radio, 

CONFEDR[12:11:37] let me tell you.


JUDGE01[12:11:48] Why did you give me the same answer?


CONFEDR[12:11:52] Beats me.


JUDGE01[12:12:00] How's the weather?


CONFEDR[12:12:14] It's been okay.  But I'm glad I have an indoor job.  I'd 

CONFEDR[12:12:26] hate to be working outside on some of these days we've had.


JUDGE01[12:12:35] Do you like the summer or winter?


CONFEDR[12:12:51] It's been okay.  But I'm glad I have an indoor job.  I'd

CONFEDR[12:43:15] Hello.


JUDGE06[12:43:42] Can I ask you a question?


CONFEDR[12:43:48] What?


JUDGE06[12:44:16] What's the name of the speech that beginns 4 scor an seven

JUDGE06[12:44:18] yrs ago?


CONFEDR[12:44:24] I don't know.


JUDGE06[12:44:40] It was written by Lincoln. You know who Lincoln was, right?


CONFEDR[12:44:46] Yeah, that's right.

CONFEDR[12:44:54] Something I can do for you?


JUDGE06[12:45:01] Tell me who Lincoln was.


CONFEDR[12:45:05] Huh?


JUDGE06[12:45:23] Lincoln. President of the U.S. during the Civil War. Ever

JUDGE06[12:45:25] hear of him?


CONFEDR[12:45:40] I don't know.  He's a good president, I guess.  I don't go 

CONFEDR[12:45:50] for all these people running down the country.

CONFEDR[12:46:00] You gotta support your president.


JUDGE06[12:46:16] Do you even know Lincoln's first name?


CONFEDR[12:46:21] Beats me.


JUDGE06[12:46:34] You are a disgrace to your country. You are American, right?


CONFEDR[12:46:42] What do you mean?


JUDGE06[12:46:50] I mean, were you born in the United States?


CONFEDR[12:46:53] What?

CONFEDR[12:47:02] Maybe I just got too much on my mind.

CONFEDR[12:47:20] I got real trouble at work.  I think I'm going to get fired.


JUDGE06[12:47:30] Maybe you have too little on your mind, you moron.


CONFEDR[12:47:34] What?


JUDGE06[12:47:44] I just said, you have too little on your mind. You are a

JUDGE06[12:47:45] moron.


CONFEDR[12:47:53] I don't know.


JUDGE06[12:48:14] What do you know? And I don't want to hear about your pathetic

JUDGE06[12:48:15] wanker job.


CONFEDR[12:48:31] Yeah, well, it's kinda on my mind, you know.  I haven't been 

CONFEDR[12:48:43] thinking about much else since my boss talked to me on Tuesday.

CONFEDR[12:48:58] He thinks I stole a radio.  It was in one of the labs that 

CONFEDR[12:48:59] I clean.


JUDGE06[12:49:13] Well, I'm sorry about all that. Let me help you think about

JUDGE06[12:49:21] other things. What did you have for dinner last night?


CONFEDR[12:49:27] No.

CONFEDR[12:49:45] I never stole nothing in my life.  But they always blame 

CONFEDR[12:49:53] the cleaners whenever anything is missing.


JUDGE06[12:50:10] How could you steal? Does your uniform even have pockets?


CONFEDR[12:50:27] Goddamn it.  I already told you I didn't take it.  You think 

CONFEDR[12:50:31] I'm a liar, too?


JUDGE06[12:50:50] no no no no!!!! I meant, I didn't think you even could steal.

JUDGE06[12:50:56] How would you get a radio out?


CONFEDR[12:51:05] You?  Don't jerk me around.

CONFEDR[12:51:20] I didn't see nobody.  Except the professor who works in the 

CONFEDR[12:51:33] lab.  He keeps it locked up.  I don`t even see any students 

CONFEDR[12:51:40] in there, like in the other labs.


JUDGE06[12:51:50] oh, who cares. it's only a job, anyway.


CONFEDR[12:52:08] I'm a cleaner.  I empty trash.  Vacuum.  Dust.  You know.


JUDGE06[12:52:25] I know. I think you could go back to college. So just quit

JUDGE06[12:52:30] this job before they fire you.


CONFEDR[12:52:43] My boss, Mr. Johnson, told me he's upset at me.

CONFEDR[12:52:58] It's all because of that radio they think I stole from the 

CONFEDR[12:53:01] lab.


JUDGE06[12:53:12] Tell them to take that job and shove it.


CONFEDR[12:53:22] Like I already told you.

CONFEDR[12:53:38] I'm a cleaner.  I empty trash.  Vacuum.  Dust.  You know.

CONFEDR[12:54:17] Yeah.  Well, it's a bad time to be out of work.  Especially 

CONFEDR[12:54:26] if my boss spreads it around that I'm a thief.

CONFEDR[12:54:58] What do you mean?


JUDGE06[12:55:13] I mean, instead of "thief" you should have written "theif."
