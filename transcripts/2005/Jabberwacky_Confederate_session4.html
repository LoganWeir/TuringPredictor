2005-09-18-11-29-10 CONFEDERATE: Hello, my name is Amy and I am the human.<br>
2005-09-18-11-31-49 JUDGE: Hi, Amy. How are you today?<br>
2005-09-18-11-32-08 CONFEDERATE: I'm great, how are you?<br>
2005-09-18-11-32-24 JUDGE: I am doing well, thanks. My name is Lila, by the
way.<br>
2005-09-18-11-32-36 CONFEDERATE: <br>
2005-09-18-11-32-50 JUDGE: I did not get a response - are you ok in there?<br>
2005-09-18-11-33-22 CONFEDERATE: Sorry, I'm fine. Where are you from?<br>
2005-09-18-11-34-30 JUDGE: From? Well, I live in NYC right now. Where are you
from?<br>
2005-09-18-11-35-08 CONFEDERATE: Originally, memphis, you know-home of Elvis.<br>
2005-09-18-11-36-23 JUDGE: I do. I was born in Nashville. My parents had just
come over from Iran. Funny place for them to start up, don't you think?<br>
2005-09-18-11-37-23 CONFEDERATE: Yeah it is a bit of an unusual choice, do they
have a thing for country music or wasit more random than that?<br>
2005-09-18-11-37-37 JUDGE: More random. Do you like living in NYC?<br>
2005-09-18-11-38-13 CONFEDERATE: Yes, I was living here a few years ago, but
left after I was laid off from my job.<br>
2005-09-18-11-38-40 JUDGE: Where do you live now?<br>
2005-09-18-11-39-04 CONFEDERATE: Bed-Stuy.<br>
2005-09-18-11-40-58 JUDGE: Do you like it? How old are you?<br>
2005-09-18-11-42-03 CONFEDERATE: Yeah, its ok, though not as much of a diverse
community as I would like. I'm 32 but look 22.<br>
2005-09-18-11-42-36 JUDGE: Really? What is your secret?<br>
2005-09-18-11-42-42 CONFEDERATE: <br>
2005-09-18-11-43-35 JUDGE: I did not get anything. Are you keeping your secret
a secret?<br>
2005-09-18-11-44-52 CONFEDERATE: Sorry, I accidently hit enter twice. No I'll
share my age-defying secret. I've pretty much avoided the sun since I was
nineteen, I have pale skin anyway.<br>
2005-09-18-11-45-41 JUDGE: Ah, the sun. I am doomed.<br>
2005-09-18-11-46-39 CONFEDERATE: Yeah, for most people its toolate to undo the
damage. Not to say that I din't coat myself with baby oil once or twice in my
preteen years.<br>
2005-09-18-11-47-22 JUDGE: Yes, I remember that. I find that as I get older, I
crave relaxing days on the beach, it I like an elixir. Anyway, congrats on
looking 10 years younger. Hopefully I'll have a chance to see for myself!<br>
2005-09-18-11-48-26 CONFEDERATE: Thanks, my elixir is libraries or beautiful
parks. The 10 years younger look though is not always a blessing.<br>
2005-09-18-11-48-48 JUDGE: Let me guess - all the younger folks are into you?<br>
2005-09-18-11-49-24 CONFEDERATE: Bingo. I couldn't be less interested in a guy
in his early 20s'.<br>
2005-09-18-11-49-59 JUDGE: I cannot say that I agree unfortunately! (ha ha). Ah
well. Are you happy?<br>
2005-09-18-11-50-41 CONFEDERATE: Most days, I have my art and my friends so its
all good.<br>
2005-09-18-11-50-56 JUDGE: You are an artist then? What kind of art?<br>
2005-09-18-11-51-32 CONFEDERATE: Drawing and painting, also I make little
artist books.<br>
2005-09-18-11-54-40 JUDGE: Sorry, I've been consumed in my other conversation.
Don't mean to ignore you.<br>
2005-09-18-11-55-04 CONFEDERATE: Its ok, though I was getting a little lonely.<br>
2005-09-18-11-56-34 JUDGE: Sorry - any last comments?<br>
2005-09-18-11-56-48 CONFEDERATE: Nice to meet you.<br>
