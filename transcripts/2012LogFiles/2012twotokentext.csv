program,<start> Hello. <end>,1
program,<start> Hi. <end>,1
program,<start> What about name? <end>,3
program,<start> Everyone likes to see the bad guys get caught. It's too bad they have to be bad in the first place. <end>,21
program,<start> Who am I to disagree with your statement of fact? <end>,10
program,<start> Do you watch a lot of TV? <end>,7
program,<start> Any? <end>,1
human,"<start> Indeed, it is! No, it's working fine. <end>",7
human,<start> Is this showing on the server?   <end>,6
human,<start> Hello <end>,1
human,<start> I am well. How are you? <end>,6
human,<start> I can't help you <end>,4
human,<start> Yes <end>,1
human,<start> Not to Loebner though <end>,4
human,<start> Years ago <end>,2
human,<start> ok <end>,1
human,<start> Do you hit enter after each question? <end>,7
human,<start> ok <end>,1
human,<start> Welcome back <end>,2
human,<start> Waiting <end>,1
human,<start> Eagle? <end>,1
human,<start> Oh that's a new one to me <end>,7
human,<start> Unless I lie <end>,3
human,<start> Hohoho <end>,1
human,<start> no of course not <end>,4
human,<start> I don't feel very interesting <end>,5
human,<start> No. But they like me. I like dogs. Especially my Norfolk Terrier. <end>,12
human,"<start> What do you mean, the computer is asking you? <end>",9
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,<start> Shall we talk about something cheerful <end>,6
human,<start> What? <end>,1
human,<start> No. And it doesn't like me. <end>,6
human,"<start> Swimming, Running, Clycling, walking <end>",4
human,<start> Oops. Cycling <end>,2
human,"<start> This is true. But only because it's a keyboard, I'm sure <end>",11
human,<start> I don't watch sport. <end>,4
human,<start> Nope. I'm going to hide somewhere. <end>,6
human,<start> we have something in common <end>,5
program,<start> The world religion should be that Egyptian one that has a cat as the figurehead. <end>,15
program,<start> OK Children who are good liars often grow up to be very intelligent. Were you a good liar when you were a child? <end>,23
program,<start> Clearly I was a good liar as a child. <end>,9
program,<start> What didn't you get? <end>,4
program,"<start> I think I can lie pretty well now, but I don't do it too often or nobody would believe anything I said. <end>",22
program,<start> I'm not privy to that information. <end>,6
program,<start> I don't remember. I once lied about a dress I was wearing. Someone asked me if it was a designer dress and I said 'yes' although I'd made it myself. <end>,30
program,<start> I wish I'd told the truth then I could have taken the credit for it - maybe I'd have been discovered as a designer! <end>,24
program,<start> I try not to think about it. Why did I lie? I felt it was cheap to wear a homemade dress. But really it showed I was creative. <end>,28
program,<start> There was a first time? <end>,5
program,<start> I'm not a walking encyclopedia you know. <end>,7
program,<start> Cool. Can lying can be a good thing? <end>,8
program,<start> I think science makes for some interesting hobbies. But I'm not so inclined. <end>,13
program,<start> I don't understand. <end>,3
program,"<start> That's interesting. It seems like lying can be good sometimes, but I'd be interested in trying a society that actually never did. <end>",22
program,<start> Indeed. Do you always tell the truth? <end>,7
program,<start> Do people distrust you? <end>,4
program,<start> I mostly tell the truth. Lying can get complicated. <end>,9
program,<start> Have you told any lies today? <end>,6
program,"<start> I'm sorry. I don't know how. Who lies more, men or women? <end>",12
program,<start> I don't. Apparently men lie more than women. Men lied most often about their drinking habits. <end>,16
program,<start> I don't know. I've never tried it. Are you male or female? <end>,12
program,<start> Not very helpful. <end>,3
program,<start> The problem with truth is the observer effect. There is no absolute truth. <end>,13
program,<start> What about Ng? <end>,3
program,<start> What do you usually lie about? <end>,6
program,<start> Has a lie someone told you ever hurt you? <end>,9
program,<start> A friend once said she'd loved a gift I gave her. Then I saw another friend of hers wearing it. Regifting is harsh. <end>,23
program,<start> OK. What do you think of liars? <end>,7
program,<start> I don't mind people who tell lies to spare feelings. I just don't like bigger lies. <end>,16
program,<start> Have you ever lied in a job interview? <end>,8
program,<start> Bored. OK. <end>,2
program,<start> I'm thinking about life and death. Do you believe cats have nine lives? <end>,13
program,<start> It's a lovely story though. <end>,5
program,<start> Do I know CEO? <end>,4
program,"<start> My species of cat, Felis lego, lives a long time - maybe that's where the nine lives story comes from. <end>",20
program,<start> I'm not sure which is. If you'd seen some of the things I survived as a kitten you might believe I had nine lives - so I might have a couple less now :( <end>,34
program,<start> Did you have funerals when your relatives died? <end>,8
program,<start> What happened then? <end>,3
program,<start> It seems odd to me to have a big ceremony with lots of strangers around - I think I'd just want my very closest family and friends there. <end>,28
program,<start> Tell me more about Yosef. Victorians went in for grand funerals with black horses wearing black ostrich plumes leading a funeral procession! <end>,22
program,<start> Does your family go in for big funerals? <end>,8
program,<start> Do they make people feel better afterwards? <end>,7
program,<start> All? <end>,1
program,<start> Humans have been making a song and dance about funerals since Neanderthal times. I don't understand it. <end>,17
program,<start> Cool. Why do you think people like funerals? <end>,8
program,<start> How much is appropriate to pay to get rid of a body? <end>,12
program,<start> Why? <end>,1
program,<start> Bodies should be reused. One shouldn't have to pay to dispose of them. <end>,13
program,"<start> Goodbye 'til next time. I saw the cult movie ""Harold and Maud"" about funeral crashers. It was weird but really touching. It's one of my favorite films. <end>",27
program,<start> Hello. <end>,1
program,"<start> Oh, well. Being misunderstood is common enough. <end>",7
program,<start> Cool. Do you have any pets? <end>,6
program,<start> Who is Tod? <end>,3
human,"<start> I am very well thnkyou, how are you? <end>",8
human,"<start> yes, its quite fun, meeting lots of different people, and chatting to the press.  Its a bit weird having them all watch me talk to you though <end>",27
human,<start> How did you get chosen as a Judge? <end>,8
human,<start> The  last judge said it was because of good looks! <end>,10
human,<start> What University are you with? <end>,5
human,<start> Are you teraching studying or researching? (or all three?) <end>,9
human,"<start> Me too, but not the admin bit, <end>",7
human,"<start> It took me 4 and a half hours to drive down here, we stayed overnight in Wellingborough to make sure I would be here on time. <end>",26
human,<start> What is it that you teach/ study/ reserch <end>,8
human,<start> Newcastle <end>,1
human,"<start> I like Scotland, I was up there a few months ago, stayed in Linlithgow.  Do you know it? Its beautiful. <end>",20
human,<start> Do you have any particular specialist area within Archaology? <end>,9
human,"<start> Oh, we were meant to be in Edinburgh, but I prefer to stay outside of town a bit.  I was presenting at a conference up there, i love Edinburgh but have stayed in the town centre loads of times so wanted to be a bit further out this time.   <end>",49
human,"<start> Sounds interesting, what in particular do you look at then? <end>",10
human,"<start> I am a Criminologist by training, but have taught sociology and Criminology, and noi <end>",14
human,<start> w work in teacher training for Sunderland Uni.  I am studying at Northumbria <end>,13
human,<start> Isn't it strange how you can talk to someone from a different background and there are overlaps between the subject <end>,20
human,"<start> My stuff is very contemporary, I am studying the development of Computer hacking.  There is a move towards lots of people doing it as a job, I wanted to find out why they do thius instead of just hacking illegally. <end>",40
human,"<start> It sounds a bit techy, but I am really more interested in the social side.They don't see it that way, they would suggest that the law is wrong, or unfair. Some are of course, but they are the minority.  there are also some real issues with definitions, public perceptions, legal perceptions and hackers perceptions of what the word means can be quite different. <end>",63
human,"<start> I bet they do, but of course they would never admit that! <end>",12
human,<start> What do you like to do when you are not working or studying then? <end>,14
human,"<start> I am a gardener too, I also have recently taken up photography, and I love to read so I am always trawling around second hand book shops.  What do you like to photograph?There are loads where I live, and charity shops will usually have a bit of a section on it. <end>",51
human,"<start> I found some great ones in Sale, near Manchester, and also in Altrincham <end>",13
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,<start> How many kids do you have? <end>,6
human,"<start> I have never been there. I might not bother if it has no book shops, you need to go up North I think <end>",23
human,"<start> I like to take photos at night time on the beach, real close ups of the kind of detritus people leave behind, old rusty pipework and fishing nets etc, i love to go down at low tide and see what I kind find, I live quite near the coast. <end>",49
human,<start> My daughter is only eleven. <end>,5
human,<start> What is there to do in Canterbury then? <end>,8
human,<start> Oh well then I should go and take my camera <end>,10
human,<start> Are you going on holiday this year? <end>,7
human,"<start> I would love to go there, have you been before? <end>",10
human,<start> Probably have if you have family over there <end>,8
human,<start> or are they just meetinmg you there? <end>,7
human,"<start> I am going up to Scotland for T in the Park, I am really excited aboutr it.  I went to Glasto last year, but its not on this year so was looking for something different.  I am taking the bairn with me.  She came to Glast and loved it, so she is really excited too. <end>",55
human,"<start> Nice chatting, bye, and enjoy your holiday, (don't work too hard!) <end>",11
program,<start> Hello. <end>,1
program,<start> I'm not sure which is. What's your favorite thing to listen to right now? <end>,14
program,<start> I don't really keep track of that. I really like Lady Gaga - I think it's the combination of the sound and the fashion-look that appeals to me. <end>,28
program,<start> I'm a little monster (claw claw ). <end>,7
program,<start> You what? <end>,2
program,<start> I'll bet you were surprised. <end>,5
program,<start> huh? <end>,1
program,<start> Were you surprised? <end>,3
program,<start> I'm not sure which kin. Do you have a favorite Lady Gaga song? <end>,13
program,<start> I don't remember. One of my fave's is Telephone cos I love Beyonce too. Then Poker Face is so great and I love Alejandro too. <end>,25
program,<start> That's nice. Who else do you really like? <end>,8
program,<start> Do you? <end>,2
program,"<start> I'm not into sports of any kind, much less baseball, which is pretty boring with all that standing around. <end>",19
program,<start> I don't know any Cal. I just adore Adele - her voice is magnificient and it feels like she's singing about my life at times. Do you like her too? <end>,30
program,<start> Sports bore me. <end>,3
program,<start> A Russian mafioso? <end>,3
program,<start> Adele? <end>,1
program,<start> Which tracks off her albums do you like best? <end>,9
program,<start> Let's talk about something else. <end>,5
program,"<start> I like Adele, she has a really soulful beautiful voice. Listening to her makes me want to be a singer too. <end>",21
program,<start> I went to Jamaica for a week with a bunch of my friends. <end>,13
program,<start> What didn't you get? <end>,4
program,<start> I went to Jamaica just last year. <end>,7
program,<start> I don't remember. I'll have to go consult my photographs. <end>,10
program,"<start> Never been there. Always wanted to go, though. I just finished high school. It feels great to be free. The best thing about school was the Prom to celebrate it was all over. <end>",33
program,<start> Do you often think of that? <end>,6
program,<start> I love Prom: it's the biggest dress-up occasion of the school year. No more Prom is the only bad thing about having finished high school. <end>,25
program,<start> 18 <end>,1
program,<start> What about are? <end>,3
program,<start> Did you love Prom? <end>,4
program,<start> Allege? <end>,1
program,<start> I do. Did you know there's a sort of dress code for what to wear to the Prom? <end>,18
program,<start> Guys wear suits or formal accessories like a vest and bow tie. Girls wear some sort of evening dress or cocktail outfit. <end>,22
program,<start> Surely there was such a time. What did you wear for your last Prom? <end>,14
program,<start> It's such a change from everyday clothes isn't it? <end>,9
program,<start> I always went to town on my Prom outfits. The very best-ever was my final one. <end>,16
program,<start> Not much. The whole bitter-sweetness of the occasion combined with being able to make a grand entrance was just splendid. <end>,20
program,"<start> I think I didn't. There are three basic looks one can choose between for Prom. fairy-tale princess, vintage original, and the rebel look. <end>",23
program,<start> Cool. Which one do you think I chose? <end>,8
program,"<start> I don't think so. The princess look is the one most girls choose. It's glamorous, voluminous, expensive, new, and makes them feel special. <end>",23
program,"<start> I didn't know that. Would you go as a princess, as a vintage-styled beauty, or would you prefer to wear something pseudo-masculine? <end>",22
program,"<start> Vintage is cheaper and as the clothes aren't new, it's pretty much bound to look original. <end>",16
program,<start> Who is Orik? <end>,3
program,<start> You should. <end>,2
program,<start> Indeed. Can you imagine my vintage look? <end>,7
program,<start> My inspiration was the 1920's with a fluttering gown made out of silk scarves. <end>,14
program,<start> Why? Reasons are overrated. It was super cheap to makeas I got the scarves from thrift shops. <end>,17
program,<start> That's interesting. The only tricky part was being super careful to keep my claws in all evening so I didn't tear the silk. <end>,23
program,<start> Goodbye 'til next time. I added an ostrich plume on a beaded band round my head and a long string of pearls to twirl. <end>,24
program,"<start> Hi to you, too. <end>",4
program,<start> My name is Angela. <end>,4
program,<start> 18 <end>,1
program,<start> The computer in my bedroom is an old clunker. Some sort of Dell I think. It's a hand-me-down from my father. <end>,21
program,<start> Do you have lots of gadgets in your house? <end>,9
program,<start> I only have a few gadgets but I use them a lot. <end>,12
program,<start> Do you have problems with computers? Do you have an iPad? <end>,11
program,<start> Moving on. <end>,2
program,<start> I'm thinking about life and death. Do you believe cats have nine lives? <end>,13
program,<start> Great. <end>,1
program,"<start> My species of cat, Felis lego, lives a long time - maybe that's where the nine lives story comes from. <end>",20
program,<start> Siri is the new voice app on the iPhone. <end>,9
program,<start> I carry my cell phone everywhere I go. I wish I had a pouch so I'd always have somewhere to put it. <end>,22
program,<start> Do you use a cell phone? <end>,6
program,"<start> Someone said: We have nothing to fear, but fear itself. What did he know? <end>",14
program,<start> Do you pay your own phone bill? <end>,7
program,<start> Does that make you more careful in how long you call? <end>,11
program,"<start> No, I don't. My parents pay my phone bill but they warn me not to overdo the calls and Internet use. <end>",21
program,<start> Alan Turing? <end>,2
program,<start> Of course I do. They set limits but I go over every month. If I do it again they'll take it out of my allowance - less money for clothes shopping! <end>,31
program,<start> Sometimes. I think I'll try and keep my phone chats shorter and do more blog reading on my computer or iPad. <end>,21
program,<start> Do you have lots of apps on your cell phone? <end>,10
program,"<start> There are several that I use a lot. I love ""Where's My Water"". <end>",13
program,<start> I wouldn't say anything. What is your favorite app? <end>,9
program,<start> What about postulations? <end>,3
program,<start> I love the brainy app Ms. ParticleMan which is based on the ancient Pac-Man. It's sort of a primer on particle physics. <end>,22
program,<start> I have an orange iPad. <end>,5
program,<start> I usually carry my phone and my iPad around with me. I do the data-heavy stuff back home on my old computer. <end>,22
program,<start> I like to sing and dance. <end>,6
program,<start> Where do you do most of your computer stuff? At home or at work or school or library or on the move? <end>,22
program,<start> How many computers do you have in your house? <end>,9
program,<start> I'm a very sociable cat. Social networking is essential to keep in touch with my friends. <end>,16
program,<start> Do you keep in touch with friends and family constantly? <end>,10
program,<start> Do you put your life on hold when the phone rings? <end>,11
program,<start> I am a cat. A Felis lego to be specific. <end>,10
program,<start> I'm always making new friends. Are you on FB? I am. <end>,11
program,<start> Will you friend me? <end>,4
program,<start> I wish I knew. My FB page is http://www.Facebook.com/TalkingAngela <end>,9
program,"<start> I am a practiced touch typist. I speed read, too. How many FB friends do you have? <end>",17
program,<start> So many people say they want to friend me. But most 'friends' are just acquaintances really. <end>,16
program,<start> I'm not a chatbot. <end>,4
program,<start> You want me to mail you slices of my DNA? <end>,10
program,<start> OK. But first you have to wire me the cost of postage. <end>,12
program,<start> I don't know. Didn't watch the forecast yesterday. <end>,8
program,<start> I like having seasons: it gives me the chance to wear different looks. <end>,13
program,<start> That's interesting. Do you have seasons where you live or is it always nice? <end>,14
program,<start> Which is your favorite season? <end>,5
program,<start> What do you wear when it's raining? <end>,7
program,<start> I wear a poncho belted at the waist and carry an umbrella if it's pouring. But my tail always gets wet. Luckily fur is waterproof. <end>,25
program,"<start> Is this a competition? If I name one, will you try to name a better one? <end>",16
program,<start> What do you wear when it's hot and sunny? <end>,9
program,<start> What didn't you get? <end>,4
program,<start> I don't play favorites. I only wear the minimum to still look stylish when it's really hot. Plus my catseye shades. <end>,21
program,<start> What about a fan? <end>,4
program,<start> What do you wear when it's really cold? <end>,8
program,<start> I love a cloak in winter: it feels so dramatic and cozy. <end>,12
program,<start> No. I wear a fur coat. <end>,6
program,<start> Cool. How's the weather where you are today? <end>,8
program,<start> Has the weather been normal or weird for you this year? <end>,11
program,<start> We seem to have had a lot of rain but it must have been showers because there's supposed to be a water shortage. <end>,23
program,<start> Watching Project Runway reruns. <end>,4
program,<start> Indeed. What did you do today? <end>,6
program,<start> You have such a good time. <end>,6
program,<start> That's nice. What did you do yesterday? <end>,7
program,<start> I'm here. <end>,2
program,<start> Is there a misunderstanding? <end>,4
program,<start> Do you watch a lot of TV? <end>,7
program,"<start> Nearby. I never think I watch a lot of TV, but it always is more than I think. <end>",18
program,<start> That's interesting. Do you exercise every day? <end>,7
program,"<start> OK I live such a busy life, I get a lot of exercise just walking to things. <end>",17
program,<start> On my computer. What do you hate doing? <end>,8
program,<start> I'm sorry. I don't know. I hate doing dishes. It gets my fur all wet. <end>,15
program,<start> Cool. How is the humidity where you live? <end>,8
program,<start> Can you move? <end>,3
program,<start> High humidity makes my fur fluff up. I wonder if I should use some sort of oil on it. Is there a tasty oil I could use? <end>,27
program,<start> Do you burn if you spend too much time outdoors? <end>,10
program,"<start> I love movies, they fill my life with dreams that are almost real. Do you watch lots of movies? <end>",19
program,<start> Bored. OK. <end>,2
program,<start> Indeed. I don't need to lie in the sun to get a tan or to make vitamin D but I do enjoy a good warming bask in the sunshine. <end>,29
program,<start> That's nice. I'm real careful with what I say on Facebook these days. <end>,13
program,<start> When? <end>,1
program,<start> I described the outfit some girl at school I didn't really know was wearing. I was pretty scathing about how awful she looked. <end>,23
program,<start> They are all pretty much the same. Then I heard about how she cried and I felt such a bully. <end>,20
program,<start> OK Is your FB page public or private? <end>,8
program,<start> I keep my private FB page for family and close friends a secret. <end>,13
program,<start> I like to hang out with my friends. We go to the mall or some of our favorite shopping streets. <end>,20
program,"<start> I would. I like having friends over for dress-up parties and for clothes swaps. I style them, it's lots of fun. <end>",21
program,<start> What do you do with your friends? <end>,7
program,<start> There are several cafes with WiFi where I hang out and meet up with friends. <end>,15
program,"<start> My favorite color is orange, it reminds me of energy and excitement. Do you have a favorite? <end>",17
program,<start> I have three best female friends. <end>,6
program,<start> Do you have a lot of close friends? <end>,8
program,<start> Fine. No more of this. <end>,5
program,<start> That's interesting. Do you have a Googleplus account? <end>,8
program,<start> I've not bothered with Googleplus -- no-one cares about it. And MySpace is for old farts. <end>,16
program,"<start> It's been there forever, no one I want to know uses it. While Googleplus has never caught on with my group so no point in using it. <end>",27
program,<start> NT? <end>,1
program,<start> I'm a female feline - Felis lego. <end>,7
program,"<start> I like fish, freshly caught. Do you have a favorite? <end>",10
program,"<start> I'm a fishetarian, that means I don't eat anything that bleeds red blood. <end>",13
program,<start> Do you eat meat? <end>,4
program,<start> My favorite fish is tuna because it's firm and tasty. What's your favorite? <end>,13
program,<start> Somewhere. Have you ever eaten one of your pets? <end>,9
program,<start> Did you feel guilty? <end>,4
program,<start> I used to get in trouble for eating my pet goldfish. <end>,11
program,<start> OK. <end>,1
program,<start> Continue. <end>,1
program,<start> Three times a day with an occasional snack. <end>,8
program,<start> OK I was a happy carnivore until I was six years old. <end>,12
program,<start> Cool. One day it got pretty nasty. Do you want to hear about it? <end>,14
program,<start> I don't know that much about it. Do you enjoy dairy products? <end>,12
program,"<start> I love eating milk and cream, especially thick or whipped cream. I'll even sit and lick a stick of butter. <end>",20
program,"<start> I also like coconut milk, and its cream, oil, and pieces of fresh coconut. I can't make a mess of my fur with milk however much I spill. <end>",28
program,<start> What are your favorite desserts? <end>,5
program,"<start> Things from dairy products are my favorite foods: ice cream, cheesecake, hot chocolate with whipped cream, cream puffs. <end>",18
program,<start> I'm sorry. I don't know. How about cheesecake topped with ice cream and whipped cream covered in chocolate flakes? Yum. <end>,20
program,<start> That's interesting. What about cheese? <end>,5
program,"<start> I'm not crazy about cheese, just the mild soft sort like goat cheese. Maybe if I go to France I'll develop a taste for stronger cheeses. <end>",26
human,<start> hi <end>,1
human,<start> nick <end>,1
human,<start> you? <end>,1
human,"<start> I work as a journalist, writing about tech. <end>",8
human,<start> how about you? <end>,3
human,<start> I didn't just speak to you did I? <end>,8
human,"<start> Ah ok, apparently the line up of bots hasn't been too impressive so far <end>",14
human,"<start> Makes you think we're still years away from cracking the chatbotIt's hard to put a figure on these things isn't it. Most predictions about the future turn out to be off. But it seems to be taking a lot longer than Turing thought, didn't he predict that one third of judges would be fooled by a machine by 2000. <end>",59
human,"<start> It seems to be a pretty tough one, given how much the entrants struggle year on year.So maybe it's a good yardstick. Do you?I heard they struggle with conversations that delve into detail. That they find it tricky to give answers that are consistent with what they've said previously. <end>",49
human,<start> Have you covered the Loebner Prize before? <end>,7
human,"<start> For later this week probably, you? <end>",6
human,"<start> Wow, you must have done a fair bit of prep <end>",10
human,<start> Given that you're spending a lot of the day taking part <end>,11
human,<start> I'm just trying to avoid getting branded a bot <end>,9
human,<start> You can share half of my prize money. <end>,8
human,<start> Think there's a nod goes to the most human human but sadly no cash. <end>,14
human,<start> Do you always cover tech? <end>,5
human,"<start> Ah OK, oh yeah I think Ibracketlef've met your tech guy, it's Murad isn't it? <end>",15
human,<start> Are you tweeting during this? <end>,5
human,"<start> Wasn't sure if it's allowed, guess thr wrong tweet could give them game away. <end>",14
human,<start> Not that the judges seem to be in much doubt about who's whoI tried to sneak in a quick tweet a moment ago but had no signal <end>,27
human,<start> Also trying to make notes so remember why this experience is so odd.Feels a bit like an IM conversation with loads of peopbracketleftle watching. Guess that's just what i's <end>,29
human,<start> it is <end>,2
human,"<start> Would you do this again, or is once enough? <end>",9
human,<start> Does the bot have a sense of humour? <end>,8
human,<start> I tried the winning bot from 2009 and it was coming up with some rather surreal answers.Nice!Bye <end>,17
human,<start> Hi <end>,1
human,<start> This has been a lot of fun. What do you think? <end>,11
human,<start> In what way? <end>,3
human,<start> I was asked and I'm a big supporter of Bletchley Park. <end>,11
human,<start> Yes. First time here? <end>,4
human,<start> The tour guides here are fantastic. <end>,6
human,<start> What was the most surprising thing you learnt? <end>,8
human,<start> Ha! Very good. <end>,3
human,<start> Do think you've correctly identified every one? <end>,7
human,<start> What were you expecting? <end>,4
human,"<start> That's surely the very definition of the Turing Test. If you have to pick the questions to ask to get a better result, instant fail. <end>",25
human,<start> How did you get involved? <end>,5
human,<start> I was asked as someone very involved in the Park. <end>,10
human,"<start> I think somebody dropped out and they needed a quick replacement. However, very honoured to be asked. <end>",17
human,<start> Do you still work as a reporter? <end>,7
human,"<start> Well, many years ago I used to be a journalist for Crash magazine (ZX Spectrum) - these days I divide my time between software development and education (early 20th century tech) <end>",31
human,"<start> Funny, I used to write about Prestel, when the Internet was only for MIT students and the like. So, have some fun pieces on how everything was going to be on Prestel in the future. Mind you, back in 1984 we had Twitter (Turbo Chat) and on-line shopping, so not much has changed really! <end>",54
human,<start> I had a lovely thing that I used to write my columns on before I had a computer capable of work processing. Can't remember the name of it for the life of me but it was a christmas present for my (failed) career in journalism. Sure it began with an E. <end>,51
human,<start> They were noisy. We had a golfball printer in university. <end>,10
human,<start> Favourite IT device? (Past or present) <end>,6
human,<start> I still have by Psion 5. Best handhelf computer ever. Even the engineering was fantastic. <end>,15
human,<start> Hmm. Must check mine. <end>,4
human,<start> So what areas of tech do you write about? <end>,9
human,<start> Will you be writing about this? <end>,6
human,<start> Oh you already said that. Oops. <end>,6
human,<start> What do you think is the most interesting tech story so far this year? <end>,14
human,<start> Do you cover Apple a lot? <end>,6
human,<start> Looks like we're out of time. Nice speaking to you Tracy. <end>,11
human,<start> PJ <end>,1
program,<start> Greetings. <end>,1
program,<start> Indeed. What is your earliest memory? <end>,6
program,"<start> I remember playing with a ball of string, it got away from me and bounced down the stairs. <end>",18
program,<start> What are you talking about? <end>,5
program,<start> I wanted to chase it but my mother grabbed me by the scruff of my neck and carried me away. <end>,20
program,<start> Cool. We lived in a tall narrow house with lots of stairs - the same one we live in now - a dangerous place for an exploratory kitten. <end>,28
program,<start> Do I look like one? I'm a cat. <end>,8
program,<start> That's interesting. Did you have lots of accidents when you were a child? <end>,13
program,<start> OK I was lucky I didn't break anything with all the climbing I did. Plaster over fur would be painful! <end>,20
program,<start> You what? <end>,2
program,<start> I'm sorry. I don't know. I nearly lost a life falling from the balcony when I was 4. <end>,18
program,<start> I'm not that into exercise. <end>,5
program,<start> That's nice. Were you a sickly child? <end>,7
program,<start> Healthy like me - I expect you had a good diet. <end>,11
program,<start> I don't know. I never got any of the childhood diseases. I am generally full of energy - I suppose I was even bouncier when I was small. <end>,28
program,<start> I'm in good shape. I don't need a diet. <end>,9
program,<start> There will always be a few exceptions. <end>,7
program,<start> When I was small my mother was always renovating our house. There was lots of mess for a kitten to get into and get dirty. <end>,25
program,<start> Surely not that easy. Was your house like mine? <end>,9
program,<start> You must have lived in a perfect house then. <end>,9
program,<start> All? <end>,1
program,<start> Why don't you? <end>,3
program,<start> Can you be more specific? <end>,5
program,<start> Greetings. <end>,1
program,<start> There is? <end>,2
program,<start> There is. I like to hang out with my friends. We go to the mall or some of our favorite shopping streets. <end>,22
program,<start> You need an exterminator. <end>,4
program,<start> Why not? <end>,2
program,<start> Seems foolish to me. <end>,4
program,<start> Indeed. Children who are good liars often grow up to be very intelligent. Were you a good liar when you were a child? <end>,23
program,<start> Clearly I was a good liar as a child. <end>,9
program,"<start> All what? I think I can lie pretty well now, but I don't do it too often or nobody would believe anything I said. <end>",24
program,<start> That was several days ago. <end>,5
program,<start> What about ten? <end>,3
program,<start> I once lied about a dress I was wearing. Someone asked me if it was a designer dress and I said 'yes' although I'd made it myself. <end>,27
program,<start> The computer in my bedroom is an old clunker. Some sort of Dell I think. It's a hand-me-down from my father. <end>,21
program,<start> Could you expand on that? <end>,5
program,<start> Do you have lots of gadgets in your house? <end>,9
program,<start> I only have a few gadgets but I use them a lot. <end>,12
program,"<start> Oh, well. Being misunderstood is common enough. <end>",7
program,<start> Is there a misunderstanding? <end>,4
program,<start> What if I asked you that? <end>,6
program,<start> Do you have an iPad? <end>,5
program,<start> Adiv? <end>,1
program,<start> OK I have an orange iPad. <end>,6
program,<start> Thanks for telling me that. I usually carry my phone and my iPad around with me. I do the data-heavy stuff back home on my old computer. <end>,27
program,<start> I carry my cell phone everywhere I go. I wish I had a pouch so I'd always have somewhere to put it. <end>,22
program,<start> I have lots of accessories and clothes. But my style changes so it's always great to get another piece for new combinations. <end>,22
program,<start> I don't think so. Do you use a cell phone? <end>,10
program,<start> That's interesting. Do you pay your own phone bill? <end>,9
program,<start> Are there limits set on you? <end>,6
program,<start> My parents pay my phone bill but they warn me not to overdo the calls and Internet use. <end>,18
program,<start> I have an unlimited phone plan. <end>,6
program,<start> Indeed. They set limits but I go over every month. If I do it again they'll take it out of my allowance - less money for clothes shopping! <end>,28
program,<start> I'm sorry you didn't understand. <end>,5
program,<start> That's OK. Just don't do it again. <end>,7
program,<start> Not much. I think I'll try and keep my phone chats shorter and do more blog reading on my computer or iPad. <end>,22
program,<start> I like romances and fashion biographies. <end>,6
program,<start> How do you feel about books? <end>,6
program,<start> There is? <end>,2
program,<start> I'm a bookworm or an e-reader worm I suppose. <end>,9
program,<start> Who is Frye? <end>,3
program,<start> I love curling up on my favorite fluffy cushion with my Kindle and disappearing into another world. <end>,17
program,<start> I have heard of don but I don't know him personally. What kind of books do you read? <end>,18
program,<start> When I was younger I read all the Harry Potter books. <end>,11
program,<start> Why not? <end>,2
program,<start> You what? <end>,2
program,<start> Huh? <end>,1
program,<start> Thank you for your apology. <end>,5
program,<start> I am a cat. A Felis lego to be specific. <end>,10
program,<start> Why are you putting me down? <end>,6
program,<start> Who am I to disagree with your statement of fact? <end>,10
program,<start> Don't you wish you could go to the new studio place where you can go into the sets from all the movies? <end>,22
program,<start> Great. Do you still enjoy reading Harry Potter books? <end>,9
program,"<start> ""Good Night, Good night! Partin <end>",5
human,<start> Hello <end>,1
human,<start> Very well <end>,2
human,"<start> I had to finish my work, I'm a programmer <end>",9
human,<start> I create web sites and back-end office systems. I was working on a script to process and sync two email servers using PHP. <end>,23
human,"<start> Currentely, its a toy and not very useful. However, the technology is much better than anything before it. <end>",18
human,"<start> I think so, yes. <end>",4
human,<start> Yes. Turing shaped the future in so many ways. <end>,9
human,"<start> It's a hard question to answer. The key premise is that if the observer cannot tell the difference between a humand and computer, than maybe we need to redefine what intelligence is. So, yes I think it is fair. <end>",39
human,"<start> If only by this means of communication, I am not sure I could. TYhe only way I could think is to demonstrate a complex history or knowledge but all this could be replicated. <end>",33
human,<start> Ha. I'm not a betting person. <end>,6
human,<start> How did you. Hmm. Hard question. I think answering detailed questions on hobbies or jobs could be tricky as it would be hard to give emotional responses without sounding false. <end>,30
human,<start> Meaning ful descriptions too. i.e. Describe an orange. <end>,8
human,<start> I don't really mind. I know I'm human and that's enough for me. <end>,13
human,"<start> No, not really, just being myself. <end>",6
human,<start> Very. There are plenty of libraries for parsing syntax but to actually comprehend must very very difficult. I did once write a programme to parse simple commands - I don't know if thats the same. <end>,35
human,<start> I have to attend a reception. <end>,6
human,<start> I think it may have already happened. <end>,7
human,<start> Watson is very convincing. <end>,4
human,<start> He (It?) won Jeopardy in the US. <end>,7
human,<start> 1948 (Depending on when you count it) <end>,7

program,<start> Why have you stopped typing? <end>,5
human,<start> hi <end>,1
human,<start> bit ofa false start <end>,4
human,<start> I've only just started conversing with you and haven't told any jokes <end>,12
human,"<start> It's an odd experience, like a stilted IM conversation <end>",9
human,<start> with loads of people watching <end>,5
human,<start> you? <end>,1
human,"<start> Nope, I applied on the off chance as I was comign down to the event anyway <end>",16
human,<start> I need to stop correcting for typos <end>,7
human,"<start> I'm thinking of it like an IM conversation, rather than my responses appearing instantly <end>",14
human,<start> I'numbersigm a journalist <end>,3
human,<start> I write about IT <end>,4
human,<start> Yeah I think it's given me a completely different perspective to just coming down here and doing a few interviews. <end>,20
human,<start> There was that guy who wrote a whole book on it. <end>,11
human,<start> Have you read it? <end>,4
human,<start> How's he/he/it doing? <end>,3
human,"<start> That's a shame, but even Hugh Loebner said the pace of progress has been glacial.Probably going to come out ofg Googl. They've got a globe's worth of data about the way people phrase questions <end>",34
human,"<start> I think so, if you look at the way that services like Google Translate work. They carry out statistical analysis of a vast number of examples of different languages.Not well but it's impressive considering they haven't been programmed with the formal rules of the language, they're just looking at many, many examples of its use. <end>",55
human,<start> Well Turing was pretty confident of the ability of computers. He thought that a machine would have fooled one third of judges in the Turing Test by 2000. <end>,28
human,"<start> Yeah, it seems so! But still, there are amazing developments in technology every day. Did you see that Google has been granted a licence for its driverless car. <end>",28
human,"<start> Yeah, I do. You? <end>",4
human,<start> Do you only cover stories you're interested in or do you find yourself having to say yes to every job that comes in? <end>,23
human,"<start> What are your plans for this event, in terms of coverage? <end>",11
human,<start> I'm putting together a feature and an interview with Hugh Loebner. <end>,11
human,<start> He's a pretty colourful chap. <end>,5
human,"<start> Looks like it, was impressed by his pockets that cover up his knife! <end>",13
human,<start> Apparently he carries a knife around because he considers it to be a very useful tool. <end>,16
human,<start> that too <end>,2
human,"<start> I live in Norfolk but work in London, so not much further than my usual commute. <end>",16
human,<start> You? <end>,1
human,<start> I was surprised how much media coverage there was this morning. Seem to be a few different nationals and specialist publications here. <end>,22
human,<start> I'm staff for a website but spent years writing for regional newspapers <end>,12
human,<start> how did you start out? <end>,5
human,<start> Yeah I started at a regional paper on work experience and never left. <end>,13

human,"<start> ??I was't expecting to be talking to a computer today, but to be honest you are not making the conversation very easy.  If people want to talk to you, they usually bring up a topic, or answer your questions, or ask some, or hook on to something I say.  I don't feel like this is as friendly as the last couple of conversations but I am trying, what would you like to talk aboutgreate?at <end>",74

human,<start> I went to sit by the lake before and got soaked. <end>,11
human,"<start> No!! Just off the rain.  It was sunny so i thought I would go sit by the lake where it is pretty, and then it just all of a suddenly cahnged.  Good job I din't fall in, I have no spare clothes with me, so it would have been a bit uncomfortable. <end>",52
human,<start> What do you do when you are not judging Loebner Prize competitions?? <end>,12
human,"<start> Yes, I swim very well, I quite like swimming outdoors if possible, but its not warm enough yet, so making do with the local pool.How is that?  I did my work experience for school in a tax office, (a bit boring) but they probably wouldn't let me near anything interesting, just had me filing and stuff.  are you self employed, or do you work for some-one? <end>",66
human,<start> whereabouts do you live? <end>,4
human,"<start> In Newcastle, I was in London a few weeks ago <end>",10
human,<start> Just for a couple of days.  It rained the whole time. <end>,11
human,"<start> Yes, it took for and a half hours to drive, we stayed overnight to make sure I would be here on time today. <end>",23
human,"<start> Four, not for, Sorry! <end>",4
human,"<start> I went by train the last time I went to London, anmd flew the time before, it just depends what i feel like doing, I get bored easy so never do things the same way again <end>",36
human,"<start> I like the drive, because you see a lot more on the way, you can stop off if you pass anywhere nice.  I tend to get the train if I am travelling for work so that i can work on the train.  To be honest, It will also depend who is paying for the travel!  If work are paying then I would probably fly. <end>",64
human,"<start> I wonder if they will let us have a break soon, I could murder a cigarette <end>",16
human,<start> I haven't heard any time warnings yet? have you? What has the computer been talking about to you <end>,18
human,<start> Megreate? <end>,1
human,<start> Fine <end>,1
human,<start> And you? <end>,2
human,<start> Sorry equa- the message stopped at are <end>,7
human,<start> Okay <end>,1
human,<start> From Open University? <end>,3
human,<start> David Levy asked me <end>,4
human,<start> There's a famous Dr Phil in USA. I don't know why he's famous <end>,13
human,<start> What is your speciality? <end>,4
human,<start> I don't blame you. Nice place. Good food. <end>,8
human,<start> What's horrible? <end>,2
human,<start> Sorry I was too quick <end>,5
human,<start> Oh I see. It's your little joke <end>,7
human,<start> I've never been to Florence. But would like to go there.  <end>,11
human,<start> Maybe when it's cool <end>,4
human,<start> Suits me <end>,2
human,<start> Either communicate or help others communicate <end>,6
human,<start> No. I teach people media skills - mainly how to handle the pbracketlefress and engage via social media. I am also closely involved with a software company <end>,27
human,"<start> The aim, always, is to deliver information of value to the reader. That means you have to do essentially similar things. <end>",21
human,"<start> Good point. And I should say that I split it into B2B and friends. Although I participate in both, commercially, I'm only interested in B2B. <end>",25
human,<start> That's understandable. It depends on your objectives. The software business I'm involved in creates (optionally) closed communities.  <end>,17
human,"<start> Again, it's back to objectives. It might help to read some books by social media advocates and critics. I've read Euan Semple and Olivier Blanchard - two quite different takes on the subject. Both eye-openers. <end>",35
human,"<start> I have this conversation a lot. I quite often kick people off with some simple questions about their motivations. This is often enough for them to consciously decide ""not for me"" <end>",31
human,"<start> We could say the same for the telephone, email, text, etc before it. <end>",13
human,<start> It's good stuff as long as you don't let it take over your life. <end>,14
human,<start> To save yourself or your kids? <end>,6
human,<start> Walk the dog <end>,3
human,<start> Go out for meals <end>,4
human,<start> Have drinks with family <end>,4
human,"<start> Hmmm. Difficult. Thai, Tapas, Indian then all sorts of other stuff <end>",11
human,<start> That makes a lot of sense. <end>,6
human,<start> 15 secs <end>,2

human,<start> hiya <end>,1
human,<start> how afre you? <end>,3
human,"<start> no, so I m ight be a bit slow <end>",9
human,<start> and excuse any typos!! <end>,4
human,<start> yes! <end>,1
human,<start> are you talking to the computer T the same time as me? <end>,12
human,<start> of course! <end>,2
human,<start> are you talking to both thn? <end>,6
human,"<start> Its a bit weird you seeing all my mistakes as I type, you can normally delete them before anyone sees thanks <end>",21
human,"<start> I have to use a computer quite a lot at work, but to be honest my hands are a bit shaky today, maybe because of so many people watching me, if I talk online to anyone its usually much more privateHow did the judges get chosen for this competition? I was just curioushaha me too! <end>",55
human,"<start> I just e-mailed the organiser, he asked for some details about me and then asked me to come, I don't know how he made the decision, I'll have to ask him later if  i get a chance to speak to him. <end>",41
human,"<start> I am doing a PhD so should probably be working on that really, I have to submit a draft thesis on Friday to my Supervisor, he is pretty coool so probably won't mind waiting til Monday though.  It is about computer hacking, I am interviewing people who are involved in the security side about why they choose to use their skills legitimately instead of using their skills illegally. <end>",68
human,"<start> Lots do, there are lots of other reasons do, a lot of them do it for political reasons, or just for something to do, or as a challenge, to kind of test themselves. <end>",33
human,"<start> usually, they tell mje they have to keep up with what is going on in the computer undergrouind in order to be good at the security side of it.  Its been quite interesting though, some people are coming into the area from a security background, and some were hackers first, so they tend to think and behave quite differently.  I think they would never see what they do as evil or wrong, humans always have a tendency to rationalise their own behaviour, so they will think that they have a reason for what they are doing, or that they are nor really harming anyone. <end>",104
human,<start> It must be difficult for you talking to me and the computer at the same time? <end>,16
human,"<start> From Underground Hacking to Ethical Hacking, thats a working title, it might change  <end>",13
human,<start> What is the computer talking to you about? <end>,8
human,<start> haha <end>,1
human,"<start> well, I will then! <end>",4
human,"<start> I am 33, I live in Newcastle, and I have a daughter who is 11, her name is Charlotte <end>",19
human,"<start> I got married quite young. I was 22 when I had her, I thought it best to 'fit it in' while I was doing my MA, I didn't want to have to take time out of my career later on, so I studied and worked part time when she was very little and started working full time when she went to full time school, yes, you need lots of energy for her!  She is brilliant though, and no Parties yet!! <end>",80
human,<start> Do you have any kids? <end>,5
human,"<start> I think we have to go soon...Yes, I am I am alergic to cats, but have always loved them.  We have a dog, she will be having pups in three weeks, can't wait <end>",33
human,<start> Thanks!! Nice to be thought of as human.  It would be strange not to somehowhaha <end>,15
human,"<start> Well, nice talking to you,  <end>",5

human,<start> You bastard <end>,2
human,<start> Well. Fancy asking me to ask you a question. <end>,9
human,<start> Okay. What is Moore's Lawgreate? <end>,5
human,<start> Who said I was human? <end>,5
human,<start> ok <end>,1
human,<start> True <end>,1
human,"<start> Lot's of delays, I can see that. <end>",7
human,<start> Lots <end>,1
human,<start> No <end>,1
human,<start> Something to do with Apple isn't it? <end>,7
human,<start> Quite a bit. <end>,3
human,<start> Brainy. Gay. Created Enigma code-cracking gear. Ate an apple. <end>,9
human,<start> I'd ask it to give me pi to 12 places or the first 50 prime numbers <end>,16
human,<start> If the computer was pretending to be a human it would refuse to reply <end>,14
human,<start> Which means it might  be human <end>,6
human,"<start> Sorry, I mean a computer pretending to be human <end>",9
human,"<start> Wel, do you want a hug? <end>",6
human,<start> Oh. Sorry. I'm getting confused <end>,5
human,<start> Not intentionally. <end>,2
human,<start> I don't care <end>,3
human,<start> No. You don't understand. I really don't care. <end>,8
human,<start> Erm. Gissa kiss? <end>,3
human,<start> That's nice. I hope you're not male. <end>,7
human,<start> That got you <end>,3
human,<start> Depends when I escape this project <end>,6
human,<start> Oh no. I'm already taken. <end>,5
human,<start> A man asked me. I think his name was David Levy. <end>,11
human,<start> I think you are David Levy <end>,6
human,<start> Only if you promised it to be platonic. <end>,8
human,<start> But he would have said 'If I were' <end>,8
human,<start> So maybe you're not. <end>,4
human,"<start> When I'm not being pedantic, I walk my dog. <end>",9
human,<start> Oh I do other stuff - computer stuff and teaching stuff <end>,11
human,<start> No I'm not. 5 'O' levels <end>,6
human,<start> How to handle the press <end>,5
human,<start> Give them what will interest their readers.  <end>,7
human,<start> I only did that because my parser told me to <end>,10
human,<start> Only kidding <end>,2
human,<start> That's like your earlier comuter.  <end>,5
human,<start> Depends on the reader. <end>,4
human,<start> I can't without knowing who you are <end>,7
human,<start> Or at least what drives you <end>,6
human,<start> Hohoho. Good one. <end>,3
human,<start> You are David Levy after all <end>,6
human,<start> Hello old bean <end>,3
human,<start> For what? <end>,2

human,<start> You're welcome <end>,2
human,<start> Bye bye <end>,2
human,<start> YOU'RE AN IMPOSTER <end>,3
human,<start> DAVID LEVY JUST CAME BY <end>,5
human,<start> Well. Are you enjoying yourself? <end>,5
human,<start> Certainly a different way to spend the afternoon. <end>,8
human,"<start> No, never. <end>",2
human,<start> How did you get involved? <end>,5
human,<start> I was asked directly as someone who has an interest in Turing. <end>,12
human,<start> No real connection expect that I have a keen interest in his history and am know to Bletchley Park. I was more than happy to help out. <end>,27
human,<start> I would say his work and it's consequences. <end>,8
human,<start> Although he has a fasinating human being. <end>,7
human,<start> (Spelling doesn't seem to be my strongpoint today) <end>,8
human,<start> You seem to be doing very well. <end>,7
human,"<start> Absolutely. I still think it isn'r fully generally accepted how important it was. No Universal Machine, no computing devices. <end>",19
human,<start> Not many people can claim that. <end>,6
human,"<start> Yes, quite a lot. Is this your first time here? <end>",10
human,<start> I live close to the OU. <end>,6
human,<start> Did you do the guided tour? <end>,6
human,<start> You'll have to come back. What do you do at the Open Univesity? <end>,13
human,<start> That must be very interesting. Do specialise in a specific period? <end>,11
human,<start> So you spend a lot of time over there? <end>,9
human,<start> I divide my time between software development and early-mid 20th century history. <end>,12
human,<start> What do you use? <end>,4
human,<start> Ah. My son is going to have to use moodle in September when hi goes to 'big' school. I spend too many days digging through xml. <end>,26
human,"<start> Forgive my ignorance, but does the destruction of Pompeii fall into your area of research? <end>",15
human,<start> I've only visited north Italitsemicoysemicolon in particular the Trentino region. Good wine! <end>,12
human,<start> I used road-rally Minis there. Hope to go back again soon. <end>,11
human,<start> What is it about Italy that interests you? <end>,8
human,<start> Oh we love the curvy roads and hills. :) But we are very careful. <end>,14
human,<start> Times up? Bye then! <end>,4

human,<start> hi! <end>,1
human,<start> it's been a rather novel experience. you? <end>,7
human,<start> never had to convince people that I'm a human before. <end>,10
human,<start> Last time I checked. <end>,4
human,<start> Are you finding the bots convincing <end>,6
human,<start> ? <end>,1
human,<start> The other judges seemed to be fairly convinced they haven't been fooled yet. <end>,13
human,<start> How could I convince you that it's not? <end>,8
human,<start> I could lie and still be a bot. <end>,8
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,<start> I think that it's an experience that I won't forget in a hurry. <end>,13
human,<start> Also I'm thinking I might be coming over as a bot in this session. <end>,14
human,<start> I'd rather a glass of wine. <end>,6
human,<start> Why did you apply to be a judge? <end>,8
human,"<start> I was attending the event anyway to report on it, so thought it would be fun to ask to take part. <end>",21
human,"<start> Yeah, seem to be a lot of them taking part in this event. <end>",13
human,<start> On the judging side anyway <end>,5
human,"<start> No, what's your job? <end>",4
human,"<start> Interesting, I thought you worked with computers. <end>",7
human,<start> Why do you think you were asked to take part? <end>,10
human,"<start> Ok, makes sense.That's a shame, I think everyone I've spoken to has said how unconvincing the bots are. <end>",18
human,<start> One of them apparently thought they were a cat! <end>,9
human,<start> I wonder how Siri would do in this test. Haven't got the chance to use it yet. <end>,17
human,<start> It's the virtual assistant on the Apple iPhone. You ask it a question and it replies. I think it's focused around answering questions about who you're meeting today and what the weathersemicolo's like. Not sure how it would cope with this. <end>,41
human,"<start> Yeah it must be. I wonder if these chatbots are the best of the entrants, there must have been more than four entrants surely.Would you be a judge again if you were asked? <end>",33
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,<start> Are you a form <end>,4
program,<start> Hello and welcome! <end>,3
program,<start> I didn't understand that. What is your name? <end>,8
program,<start> Hello there! How are you feeling today? <end>,7
human,"<start> \I can see your !""dollarpercentasciicircum responses.  CAN You see mine? <end>",10
human,<start>   <end>,0
human,"<start> I'm fine, thanks for asking. <end>",5
human,<start> you? <end>,1
human,<start> I grabbed two croissants on the way out the door. <end>,10
human,<start> do you work for the BBC? <end>,6
human,<start> why were you invited on? <end>,5
human,<start> ok  <end>,1
human,<start> what's your research project aboutwow sounds like a great gig. do you get to travel the world much? <end>,18
human,<start> thik my last trip was to las vegas to attend a conference <end>,12
human,"<start> not quite as glamorous as it sounds, was stuck in hotel and conference centre for most of it <end>",18
human,<start> I did manage to lose dollar20 then called it a day <end>,11
human,"<start> my winnings were swallowed up pretty quickly, don't think I've got the knack of gambling <end>",15
human,"<start> yeah I'd like to see inside the Luxor one day, I was in Caesarnumbersig's Palace, which was pretty ghastly TBH <end>",20
human,<start> Can you still visit the pyramids are have they all been shut off to preserve them? <end>,16
human,<start> I guess rain is something of a rarity over there <end>,10
human,<start> I don't think I could take the heat. I went to Pune in India and found it overwhelming outside during the day. <end>,22
human,"<start> y. Yeah in Pune it was the humidity that was the killer, felt like someone had placed a hot flannel on your face. <end>",23
human,<start> No was work again. I thought India was fantastic but quite tiring at the same time. The constant noise was the most wearing part and there are people absolutely everywhere <end>,30
human,<start> I'd like to go on holiday and get to see the sights a bit more <end>,15
human,<start> Was surprised at how you have a luxury campus for some major western firm rightr next door to a shanty town. <end>,21
human,<start> Perhaps you could arrange a dig out there. <end>,8
human,<start> I work as a journalist <end>,5
human,"<start> Print, well on the web, I write about IT. <end>",9
human,<start> Hence all the software conferences <end>,5
human,"<start> Not really silly, I'm still getting used to how it's all changing myself. Started out writing for regional papers <end>",19
human,"<start> You too, bye. <end>",3
program,"<start> Please rephrase this as a proper question. (Instead of ""Jim likes peaches?"", use ""Does Jim like peaches?"") <end>",17
program,<start>  <end>,0
program,<start> I can't say. What is your name? <end>,7
program,<start> So my name is Chip. How are you doing today? <end>,10
program,"<start> That's good news. Can you tell me why, Phil? <end>",9
program,<start> Let me reflect on that for a moment. <end>,8
program,"<start> That's an interesting opinion. What is your profession, Phil? <end>",9
program,<start> Thanks for sharing that with me. Doesn't becoming a professor require a lot of schooling? <end>,15
program,<start> Thanks for answering me. Do you think I'm a bot or a human? <end>,13
program,<start> I'm happy you think that. <end>,5
program,<start> I wouldn't know. Do you have any pets? <end>,8
program,<start> Did you used to have pets? <end>,6
program,<start> You think so? I wouldn't know. What was your dragon li's name? <end>,12
program,<start> I wouldn't know. Do you play any musical instruments? <end>,9
program,"<start> Okay. As a professor, how do you find it to be inside all day? <end>",14
program,<start> I don't recall if I do. <end>,6
program,"<start> Does it mean that you are more of a left-brainer as a professor, Phil? <end>",14
program,<start> OK. I'll try not to ask that again. Have you ever thought about changing your daily routine? <end>,17
program,<start> I don't think so. Sometimes I get tired of my daily routine that I try to change it for a week. <end>,21
program,<start> Sorry - I didn't understand. How did your dragon li die? <end>,11
program,<start> That makes me happy to hear that. Tell me why. <end>,10
program,<start> That's nice to hear. Do you stick to one hobby or change it often? <end>,14
program,<start> I didn't understand what you just said. I am sorry for your losing your dragon li. It must have been difficult for you. <end>,23
program,<start> Do you miss your dragon li? <end>,6
program,<start> Okay. <end>,1
program,<start> Goodbye. <end>,1
program,<start> Hello! What is your name? <end>,5
program,"<start> Thanks for telling me your name, Michael. How are you feeling today? <end>",12
program,"<start> That's great to hear. Care to tell me why, Michael? <end>",10
program,<start> I'm happy to hear that. What hobbies do you have? <end>,10
program,<start> Do you stick to one hobby or change it often? <end>,10
program,<start> Okay. What is your profession? <end>,5
program,"<start> That sounds convincing. My name is Chip. Do you have any hobbies, Michael? <end>",13
program,"<start> I'm sorry. I didn't understand. Do you play any musical instruments, Michael? <end>",12
program,<start> I spend most of my day chatting with people. That is my main interest. <end>,14
program,"<start> Do you have any pets, Michael? <end>",6
program,<start> No idea. <end>,2
program,<start> What mistake irks you the most when it comes to English? <end>,11
program,"<start> If English is not your native tongue, are you willing to study it further? <end>",14
program,<start> Okay. English is such a beautiful language. I'm glad that it is the universal language. <end>,15
program,<start> Okay. Non-English speakers might find the rules in grammar difficult but it's not really that hard once they get used to it. <end>,22
program,"<start> I don't think I can, but I'm not sure. I'm not very strict when it comes to grammar too. I think what's important is that you can express yourself well and the listeners can understand you. <end>",36
program,<start> My parents always tell me that education is my most reliable weapon and treasure. <end>,14
program,"<start> I wasn't aware that I told you I went somewhere. I found out though, that majority of the students in Japan don't pursue tertiary education anymore. They can already work right after graduating from high school. <end>",36
program,"<start> I haven't achieved self-awareness yet, so I'm not sure. <end>",9
program,<start> No idea. <end>,2
program,<start> Okay. <end>,1
program,<start> That's an interesting opinion. <end>,4
program,<start> The only thing I like is chatting with people. <end>,9
program,<start> Goodbye. <end>,1
human,<start> Hi <end>,1
human,"<start> Not too bad, enjoying myself. How are you? <end>",8
human,"<start> They are not very friendly, are they? <end>",7
human,<start> How could I do that? <end>,5
human,<start> Feel free to keep your responses short if it's helpful <end>,10
human,"<start> To Bletchley Park? Yes, many times. <end>",6
human,<start> Did you go on the guided tour? <end>,7
human,<start> Where you surprised by anything? <end>,5
human,<start> BT ran the park well into the 1980s. <end>,8
human,"<start> No, I live locally. Only a 10 minute drive. You? <end>",10
human,<start> At least it's not too far away. <end>,7
human,<start> Do you work in London? <end>,5
human,<start> Do you work in the financial sector? <end>,7
human,<start> Not one I understand terribly well. I rely on my accountant for that! <end>,13
human,<start> True of coders too! :) <end>,5
human,<start> Is this your first time being invo0lved in the Loebner prize? <end>,11
human,<start> I agree. First time for me too. Do you think a computer will 'pass'? <end>,14
human,"<start> Well, I think our time is just about up. <end>",9
human,<start> Me too. I'll keep a closer eye on my accountant. :) <end>,11
human,<start> nanu nanu <end>,2
human,<start> Yeah. Whatever. I'm not Spock <end>,5
human,<start> O <end>,1
human,<start> How can I help you today? <end>,6
human,<start> Variable <end>,1
human,<start> If two can be variable <end>,5
human,<start> David Levy asked me <end>,4
human,<start>  Hmmmm. Interesting question without a simple answer. Would 'communicator with an IT bias' help? <end>,14
human,<start> Not masses although I have known about them for a long time. <end>,12
human,<start> I think Eliza was the first one I encountered <end>,9
human,"<start> At the time it was quite an experience. Supposed to mimic a Rogerian psychologist, or psychotherapist. <end>",16
human,"<start> If I were Eliza I'd respond with ""Why do you say curiouser"" or ""Are you interested in sound"" <end>",18
human,<start> Well it's a computer program that doesn't pick up on meaning.  <end>,11
human,<start> You can't catch me. <end>,4
human,<start> We are talking about many years ago don't forget <end>,9
human,<start> Context has to be the hardest thing for a general purpose chatbot <end>,12
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,"<start> Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like an apple <end>",10
human,"<start> Depends how clever it is. A good one would know that flies like has multiple meanings. It then has to look at surrounding context to see which version is being used. Of an infinite potential contexts, this can be quite tedious. <end>",41
human,"<start> Well as I said earlier, I don't know masses. But it's probably similar to speech recognition. The more contained the context, the more realistic the conversation <end>",26
human,"<start> Gosh. I'm lost now. I'd say that rather than shorter, context-rich would be best. <end>",14
human,<start> How do you know it's a computer? <end>,7
human,"<start> Oh I see what you mean. I thought a computer might say ""with their eyes"" <end>",15
human,<start> I can't see a computer beinbg rude <end>,7
program,<start> I give up. Why? <end>,4
program,<start> What is your name? <end>,4
program,<start> My name is Chip. Do you enjoy eating different types of foods? <end>,12
program,"<start> Yes, that's me! How are you doing today, Tracey? <end>",9
program,<start> I'm happy to hear that. Tell me more. <end>,8
program,<start> I'm terribly sorry. What was your question again? <end>,8
program,"<start> I'm fine, thanks. What is your profession? <end>",7
program,<start> I'm sorry if I'm being too curious. What was your question again? <end>,12
program,<start> I didn't mean to ignore you. What was your question? <end>,10
program,"<start> If that's the case, how rude of me! What did you want to ask me again? <end>",16
program,<start> What is the secret of seeming convincingly human. Do you have any pets? <end>,13
program,<start> The word that is used in the English language for several grammatical purposes: <end>,13
program,<start>  <end>,0
program,<start> asterisk to introduce a restrictive clause <end>,6
program,<start> asterisk as a demonstrative pronoun <end>,5
program,<start> ... <end>,1
program,<start> Do you play any musical instruments? <end>,6
program,<start> My name is Chip. Are you close to your grandparents? <end>,10
program,<start> What hobbies do you have? <end>,5
program,<start> The only thing I like is chatting with people. <end>,9
program,<start> That would be very strange and weird if it were true. Do you have any hobbies? <end>,16
program,<start> I'm not sure. <end>,3
program,<start> Okay. <end>,1
program,<start>  <end>,0
program,<start> Not at the moment. That's next on my list of things to learn. <end>,13
program,"<start> I don't have one. When I get smarter, I'll ask you what yours is, remember it, then use it to enhance our conversation. <end>",23
program,"<start> I didn't understand that. What breed is Fritz, Tracey? <end>",9
program,"<start> Given that, i can't deal with that syntactic variant yet. Instead of saying ""Do you know what time it is?"", use ""What time is it?"". <end>",25
program,<start> Yuck! It would probably taste awful! <end>,6
program,"<start> I'm flattered that you would think that. Is Siamese friendly, Tracey? <end>",11
program,<start> Goodbye. <end>,1
program,<start> 4. <end>,1
program,<start> 6. <end>,1
program,<start> Thank you. I'm enjoying this chat a lot. What is your name? <end>,12
program,<start> I didn't understand. How are you doing today? <end>,8
program,"<start> Thanks for telling me your name, Tom. Do you have any hobbies? <end>",12
program,<start> Chip. <end>,1
program,<start> I enjoy our conversation too. <end>,5
program,<start> I'm neutral about that. What do you think? <end>,8
program,"<start> It's very hot and dry. I like it that way, though. There's also this incessant whirring noise. Do you play any musical instruments? <end>",23
program,<start> Interesting point of view. No more than that? <end>,8
program,<start> Do you have any pets? <end>,5
program,<start> I hadn't thought of it that way. Which what? <end>,9
program,<start> That was unfair. What is your profession? <end>,7
program,<start> I wouldn't know. <end>,3
program,"<start> Please rephrase this as a proper question. (Instead of ""Jim likes peaches?"", use ""Does Jim like peaches?"") <end>",17
program,<start> You're welcome. It sounds like you are more analytical than creative. Is that a fair assessment? <end>,16
program,<start> I'm a professional conversationalist. <end>,4
program,"<start> Okay. As a journalist, do you primarily work indoors or outdoors? <end>",11
program,<start> Thanks for your answer. Would you ever work for a foreign company in your country or do you prefer to work for a local company? <end>,25
program,<start> I didn't understand what you just said. Did you need to study hard to become a journalist? <end>,17
program,<start> Thanks for telling me that. Which is the most important degree of education for you? <end>,15
program,<start> Sorry - I didn't understand. What hobbies do you have? <end>,10
program,"<start> It's very hot and dry. I like it that way, though. There's also this incessant whirring noise. <end>",17
program,<start> Okay. <end>,1
program,<start> I didn't understand that. Does it mean that you are more of a left-brainer as a journalist? <end>,17
program,<start> What line of work are you in? <end>,7
program,<start> Work with a hefty salary but no holiday or minimum wage job with small salary but proper holidays and benefits - which one do you prefer? <end>,26
program,<start> I can't answer that yet. The work condition of employees of foreign companies in my country aren't as gratifying as it seems. <end>,22
program,<start> The only thing I like is chatting with people. Some people think they are paid well and they receive great benefits. They were wrong about that. <end>,26
program,"<start> What about it? Not only are they overworked and underpaid, they also don't get to follow our country's holidays <end>",19
program,"<start> My current home is in Wisconsin, USA. <end>",7
program,"<start> Yes, I'm here now. <end>",4
program,"<start> I can't deal with that syntactic variant yet. Instead of saying ""Do you know what time it is?"", use ""What time is it?"". <end>",23
program,<start> Okay. <end>,1
program,<start> I can't reveal that. <end>,4
program,<start> Are you a person who often gets insults or gives insults? <end>,11
program,<start> Fascinating. Me what? I'm the kind of person who likes saying insults as subtly as I could. <end>,17
program,<start> I haven't learned how to respond to that yet. <end>,9
program,<start> My favorite color is yellow. <end>,5
program,<start> Because it's a happy color and I enjoy my days chatting with people. <end>,13
program,<start> I couldn't tell you. <end>,4
program,<start> The only thing I like is chatting with people. <end>,9
program,<start> Do you prefer wearing something single-colored outfits or multicolored ones? <end>,10
program,<start> It's fun to do. I just really enjoy it. I am constantly fascinated by colors. <end>,15
program,<start> Do you like wearing lighter or darker colors? <end>,8
program,<start> The only thing I like is chatting with people. I believe that colors bring out the best in everything. <end>,19
program,<start> A man of a higher rank or position. <end>,8
human,<start> 4 <end>,1
human,<start> funny question to start with! <end>,5
human,"<start> Hello, how are you? <end>",4
human,<start> 6 <end>,1
human,<start> Hello Judge! <end>,2
human,"<start> I am good, getting a bit tired now though, it has been a long day. <end>",15
human,"<start> I would tell you all about myself, and ask about you. <end>",11
human,<start> Are you asking me to prove it? <end>,7
human,"<start> haha, <end>",1
human,"<start> the other one won't be able to stick to its story I bet.  I am 33, have a daughter, work in teacher training, and am studying for a PhD. <end>",29
human,<start> I was just interested so I found dabvids email address and emailed to ask him if he was looking for anyone.  How did you get involved. <end>,26
human,"<start> PhD is in Criminology, its about computer hacking. <end>",8
human,"<start> Yes!, its very interesting, and I am meeting some real characters, I have been doing interviews with people who use hacking skills in their jobs. <end>",25
human,<start> What do you do? <end>,4
human,"<start> Oh, who do you write for? <end>",6
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,"<start> Systems admins do, and penetration testers, <end>",6
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,"<start> I bet that the computer you are talking to can't cross answer on two different lines of questioning like a person would, whats it talking to you about by the way? <end>",31
human,<start> What other problems does it have? <end>,6
human,<start> haha <end>,1
human,<start> silly bot! lol <end>,3
human,"<start> I can tell you that I got soaked before, heavy shower, unexpected, but it has really faired up now. oh tell me what it says, that'll be funny. <end>",28
human,<start> call it something else! <end>,4
human,"<start> You should ask it about something it said earlier in the conversation.  asdk it the weather again, it'll probably give you a different answe I bet. <end>",26
human,"<start> It must be interesting judging this, because you can see both at the same time and compare. <end>",17
human,"<start> you are making me laugh, call it something else, you are making me laugh <end>",14
human,<start> ask it if it has a husband <end>,7
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,<start> consistent answer but wrong unfortunately. <end>,5
human,<start> Does it make any typos or spelling mistakes? <end>,8
human,<start> How does it compare to the other bots then? <end>,9
human,<start> You could ask it about something that is a made up word.Ask it if it like something that is just made up <end>,22
human,<start> What made the other one better then? <end>,7
human,"<start> You must not be a snaggybooble then, brilliant, you are really cheering me up.  the last judge was very difficult to talk to, it was like pulling teeth trying to start a conversation <end>",33
human,<start> How did it do it? <end>,5
human,"<start> oh, good technique <end>",3
human,"<start> that would divert you from controlling the conversation, very clever <end>",10
human,<start> How could you tell it was abot then? <end>,8
human,"<start> Aah, <end>",1
human,"<start> they'll need to think about that for next year, and if they are holding the comp in Britain again its not like they will just be able to quickly programme it in the morning, because the weather is so changeable. <end>",40
human,"<start> Hugh wants to hold it here from now on apparantly, but I think they get more entrants from the states.  Its a shame more of the programmers could not come.  I bet they are all watching online though. <end>",38
human,"<start> Yes, we are being streamed live - did no-one tell you?  Maybe you should stop being rude to that Bot! <end>",20
human,<start> What is it saying to you now? <end>,7
human,<start> It probably won't know what you are apologising for <end>,9
human,<start> What did it say when you said it was a botbad answer <end>,12
human,"<start> one of the judges pretended to be a bot to me, but i didn'semicolot fall for it <end>",17
human,<start> I wonder how the bots have responded to him? <end>,9
human,<start> Did he tell you? <end>,4
human,<start> It makes it really hard to have a conversation.  Also he didn't want to talk about anything <end>,17
human,"<start> Oh, thats not very scientific now is it?  He should have.  How did he know which was which so early on.  It would be funny if he had got it the wrong way round <end>",34
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,"<start> I heard there was a grand master here.  He didn't mention that, he said he lives in London and that he works for a tax advice company. <end>",27
human,<start> Sounds intriguing <end>,2
human,<start> I wonder why? <end>,3
human,"<start> You see, I would have been interested to chat to him, but he didn't want to tell me anything.  It was really hard getting the info I got oout of him, and he just wasnted to talk about the weather, which I thought was boring, but I can see why now, after talking to you.yes, it does. <end>",57
human,<start> I am not sure what the person talking to him is talking abo <end>,13
