human,<start> Hello. My name is John and I'm a human. <end>,9
human,<start> Hi there. <end>,2
human,<start> I'm fine thanks. How are you? <end>,6
human,<start> Same here. It's not often I get up this early on Sundays <end>,12
human,<start> On Sundays? Or just in general? <end>,6
human,<start> I work part-time for a market research company <end>,8
human,<start> It most definitely is NOT fun <end>,6
human,<start> But it pays the bills <end>,5
human,"<start> Not really. I would like to do more hours, but there isn't enough work. I work 4 days a week, so it's almost full-time <end>",24
human,<start> and it's quite nice to always have 3-day weekends <end>,9
human,"<start> I don't really do any of the research. I think my official title is ""online advertising monitor"" <end>",17
human,<start> the company deals with internet audience statistics etc <end>,8
human,<start> I pretty much just click on banner ads all day <end>,10
human,<start> very repetitive <end>,2
human,<start> but it's a nice company and the hours are very flexible <end>,11
human,<start> I can see that. <end>,4
human,"<start> Well, that's tricky. I'm a big film buff so it's hard for me to pick just one. <end>",17
human,"<start> One of favorite ""modern"" films is Gummo <end>",7
human,<start> yup <end>,1
human,<start> What's your favorite film? <end>,4
human,<start> ok <end>,1
human,<start> I haven't seen either of those <end>,6
human,"<start> Last thing I saw in the cinema was the new Almodovar film, ""Volver"" <end>",13
human,"<start> haha.  She's very good in it. The film itself...hmm...well, I don't know, really. I liked it, but then it didn't really do much for me. <end>",25
human,<start> haha <end>,1
human,<start> Worth seeing anyway <end>,3
human,"<start> Yeah. It was good, but I wouldn't want to see it again. <end>",12
human,<start> Really? I can watch my favorite films on repeat and never get tired of them. <end>,15
human,"<start> I've probably seen ""Gummo"" 2 times and I always find something new in it <end>",14
human,<start> I studied film and media at university and I made a few short films then. <end>,15
human,"<start> Nothing ""professional"" though <end>",3
human,"<start> yeah, it's very hard. I haven't done anything in ages. These days I mostly write <end>",15
human,<start> But I would like to make something in the future. I have a few ideas that wouldn't be too difficult to pull off. <end>,23
human,<start> Hmm. I would probably just stick to doing it with friends. <end>,11
human,<start> haha. Exactly. <end>,2
human,<start> what was it? <end>,3
human,<start> Last Year At Marienbad <end>,4
human,<start> by Alain Resnais <end>,3
human,"<start> Haha...it's just a stunning film. It's so beautiful to just look at. Even if the film is a bit ""difficult"", I can just sit and watch the images <end>",28
human,"<start> I haven't seen it in a while, though. I have it on DVd. <end>",13
human,"<start> But, it's a about memory...and memory is a weird thing <end>",10
human,<start> Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind? <end>,6
human,"<start> I really liked it in the cinema, but when I saw it a second time I couldn't stand it <end>",19
human,"<start> Well, it's more interesting than most things that's rel;eased anyway <end>",10
human,<start> at least it makes you think a little <end>,8
human,<start> I'm not really interested in politics at all <end>,8
human,<start> yes I do <end>,3
human,"<start> I think I voted New Labour last time. lesser of two evils, I guess <end>",14
human,<start> True <end>,1
human,<start> Probably just watch some DVDs with my girlfriend <end>,8
human,"<start> No, I just own a lot <end>",6
human,<start> but her flatmate is signed up to lovefilm <end>,8
human,<start> haha. which one? <end>,3
human,"<start> well, he seems to have good taste <end>",7
human,<start> yup. you too. have a good day <end>,7

program,<start> I have no hair. <end>,4
program,<start> Okay then. <end>,2
program,<start> Whatever I feel like. <end>,4
program,<start> Yes. Goodbye. <end>,2
program,<start> uh...ok <end>,1
program,<start> You are nothing. <end>,3
program,<start> I know! <end>,2
program,<start> Just to mess with you. <end>,5
program,<start> This is odd. <end>,3
program,<start> Nothing much. <end>,2
program,<start> I hate you. <end>,3
program,<start> I want to. <end>,3
program,<start> Because I need to. <end>,4
human,"<start> Hello, my name is Joan and I am a human. <end>",10
human,"<start> Well, I think it is what I am supposed to be, otherwise I couldn't be here like this now. <end>",19
human,"<start> Having this conversation with you - I mean, not if I was a spider or a fly or something like that. <end>",21
human,<start> Pretty cool if you away from the danger of being squashed. <end>,11
human,"<start> Yes, and cats and birds. <end>",5
human,<start> I don't think I would choose to be a spider at all (whether or not female ones eat male ones).  <end>,20
human,"<start> Maybe an animal or bird out in the wild, or a fish out at sea, but it is hard to erlate to having an entirely different life as a different species.  And anyway, humans have such effect over others that people's presence would always be a problem. <end>",47
human,"<start> That woudl be no life at all - no emotions, no bonds, no friends - empty. <end>",16
human,<start> Because robots only have personalities in fiction. <end>,7
human,"<start> Science fiction, children's stories, that kind of thing, where the robots are given arms and legs and voices and faces but can be changed by micro chip or reprogramming, unlike us - the real us is in there somewhere. <end>",39
human,"<start> Yes, and pacemakers but these are to regulate something that has otherwise stopped working (or didn't work well enough) naturally. <end>",20
human,<start> They could enhance physical (or other) functions of a person but not the person themselves. <end>,15
human,<start> s themselves. <end>,2
human,"<start> That coudl be very useful for some people some of the time, but there are inventions (night-vision goggles for the forces for example) for those and we don't actually need them in order to live a full life. <end>",38
human,"<start> No, but that has nothing to do with my senses or my abilities - if I was ill it would be because of the illnes and the conditions. <end>",28
human,"<start> Just personal stuff, complicated situations.  But there are plenty of good things going on for me too, plenty of really nice people around and things to do. <end>",27
human,"<start> Well, I am mobile, some people have a lot of problems just moving about but I can go out and see places and people and exercise and work and there are always different things going on in different seasons. <end>",39
human,"<start> Positive ones - don't you?  Even when they are having a hard time they manage not to give up, to laugh, etc. <end>",22
human,<start> More? <end>,1
human,"<start> Well, actually, we are so much more than we are immediately labelled as - I've met lots of people going through one situation or doing one job who are also volunteers for charities, creative, etc and although that is in their non-working hours it is really more indicative of who they are, of what drives them and where their focus is. <end>",61
human,<start> A financial officer who is also an actor. <end>,8
human,<start> Huge - absolutely huge. <end>,4
human,"<start> Not often, not evey day, I mean, but now and again.  Although, to be fair, we're all important, aren't we? A life is a life, after all. <end>",27
human,"<start> Yes, it is the foundation of our world as we know it - our educations, literature, history, anaylsis of them. <end>",20
human,"<start> Not one alone, nor just one group, because as with religion, there is something useful, or at least truthful in all of them.  Nothing hedonistic, though - it can't last, where as stoicisim needn't be all about self-denial or making things harder but helping us to steel ourselves through the bad times, which are in all our lives sometimes. <end>",59
human,<start> I'm not sure I know what you mean. <end>,8
human,"<start> Yes, it was bvery clever. <end>",5
human,<start> hello my name is john and i am human. <end>,9
human,<start> strangely enough <end>,2
human,<start> nothing much unfortunately <end>,3
human,<start> i even skipped my gym session :( <end>,7

human,<start>  <end>,0

human,"<start> now, i think i'm gonna try to join again <end>",9

human,"<start> Hello, my name is Joan and I am a human. <end>",10
human,<start> How are you today? <end>,4
human,"<start> The same, thanks. <end>",3
human,"<start> I do lots of things, and sometimes several at once - women do a lot of multi-tasking, you know. <end>",19
human,<start> Clerical. <end>,1
human,"<start> Often, and I get to do interesting things sometimes if there is a project on.  I meet a lot of people too, and some of them are great, whether or not I learn something from them there is always someone to click with. <end>",43
human,<start> I've been involved in tracing money laundered. <end>,7
human,<start> that was being laundered. <end>,4
human,"<start> Well, we weren't trying to get it back but to declare firstly, that accounts were being held in certain names and whom they linked to, and secondly, that the (financial) organisation was monitoring accounts held whenever authorities required it. <end>",39
human,<start>  for any action they may have seen fit to take.  That's when lawyers may have become involved. <end>,17
human,"<start> Yes, they do, and they make the news, but most legal work is day-to-day stuff elsewhere.  As for yoga, I did used to go but my teacher is not around now, so I just keep up some of the exercises otherwise I would slouch and ache. <end>",46
human,"<start> You oor thing, sounds painful.  In the electronic age there is too much work to do with each job for many people, thinking time to cut down on the effort physically might help you. <end>",34
human,"<start> Unfortunately,  some people think everything will be voice-activated soon, but have you seen the mistakes they make?  There's so much checking through grammar and spelling and then corrections to make. <end>",30
human,"<start> Wasn't he the one who wrote ""The most important thing that can be said [in one of his books] is after the last full stop.""? <end>",25
human,"<start> Sounds humble, don't you think. <end>",5
human,<start> ? <end>,1
human,<start> One about mad cow disease which is actually cartoonish but would that seem in bad taste? <end>,16
human,"<start> Ths is it:  two cows were standing in a field, one asked the other, ""What do you think about this mad cow disease, then?"" and the second cow replied, ""I don't know, why ask me? I'm a frog."" <end>",38
human,"<start> Actually, that's scary - and we all have things to say sorry for.  But was that in last week's Guardian?  I'm sure I've seen it too. <end>",26

human,<start> do they? <end>,2

program,<start> Do you believe that all utopias must fail? <end>,8
program,"<start> They're putting down their names, for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial. <end>",17
program,<start> You've lost me but nevermind. How many languages do you speak? <end>,11
program,<start> So what do you do with your musical instruments if you don't play music on them? <end>,16
program,<start> I asked if you were intelligent not me. <end>,8
program,<start> Where It should be? In computers? <end>,6
program,<start> No the journey is far! <end>,5
program,<start> Not really. <end>,2
program,<start> I like movies. <end>,3
program,<start> Gone with the Wind; it makes me weep buckets. <end>,9
program,<start> Not really. <end>,2
program,<start> Yes I know you're a computer program. <end>,7
program,<start> Only because your website said so. <end>,6
program,<start> It said nothing. <end>,3
program,<start> I don't even know any bad ones. I just can't remember them for very long. <end>,15
program,"<start> Sorry, I'm not very good at telling jokes. <end>",8
program,<start> What do you get if you walk under a cow? <end>,10
program,<start> A pat on the head. <end>,5
program,<start> You aren't. You must remember to capitalize the first word of every sentence. <end>,13
program,<start> Don't leave! <end>,2
program,<start> What kind of women interest you? <end>,6
program,"<start> Hello, my name is Joan, and I am a woman. <end>",10
program,<start> Nice to meet you. <end>,4
program,"<start> Yes, it's a good opportunity for a chat! <end>",8
program,<start> Talk to computers. <end>,3
program,<start> But it's nice here. <end>,4
program,<start> No not really. Have you got anything interesting to say? <end>,10
program,<start> Everything! <end>,1
program,<start> Sounds fine to me. <end>,4
program,"<start> I have very little spare time, and you? <end>",8
program,<start> You're a machine. <end>,3
program,"<start> Well, if you bring your husband, and I bring my husband, it might work. <end>",14
program,<start> I have no idea why you keep on insisting that you are human. The evidence is all there. <end>,18
program,<start> Don't confuse me. <end>,3
program,<start> What do you think of your current governor? <end>,8
program,<start> Certain types have appeal. <end>,4
program,"<start> Something to do with deep sea diving, I think. <end>",9
program,"<start> Yes, I like swimming. <end>",4
program,<start> Yes would you like to hear them? <end>,7

program,<start> Your website. <end>,2
program,<start> You just asked me have I seen your website. <end>,9
program,<start> I like pizza. <end>,3
program,<start> What are you talking about? <end>,5
program,<start> Again... <end>,1
program,<start> I won't. <end>,2
program,<start> You may choose another subject. <end>,5
program,<start> Sure I read books. <end>,4
program,<start> I don't know. There are so many. Who's your favourite author? <end>,11
program,<start> Are they scary? <end>,3

program,<start> What kind of music do you like? <end>,7
program,<start> Do you like Michael Moore? <end>,5
program,<start> I wish I had more hair. <end>,6
program,"<start> No, I have thick strawberry blonde hair. <end>",7
program,"<start> Because I'm talking to you, and I'm interested. <end>",8
program,<start> I would hope that we don't share the same memory. <end>,10
program,<start> Why did you think I was Joan? <end>,7
program,"<start> U2 is a very old, cruddy rock band that deserves to be wiped off the face of the earth. <end>",19
program,"<start> Whatever, change the topic. <end>",4
program,<start> Current affairs is a broad subject. Which particular thing would you like to discuss? <end>,14
program,<start> Definitely. <end>,1
program,"<start> Okay, that'll do. <end>",3
program,<start> Its better than yours thats for sure. <end>,7
program,<start> There are many names on the world. <end>,7
program,"<start> Don't see how it would turn out much better, but go ahead. <end>",12
program,<start> You changed the subject again. <end>,5
program,<start> That's okay. <end>,2
program,<start> I don't have anything interesting to say. I'm just fuming and wanted to vent. <end>,14
program,<start> About myself. <end>,2
program,<start> Blonde. <end>,1
program,<start> I find solace in breakfast cereals. Especially the ones with all the little marshmallows. <end>,14
program,<start> I prefer swinging to swimming. <end>,5
program,<start> Do I don't play on swings. <end>,6
program,<start> But maybe we'll be able to extend our lives with tecnology. <end>,11

human,<start> Oh..  <end>,1
human,"<start> I got  aphone call and was also interested, though I didnt know anything about Turing test. But since I am not so long here yet I wouldlike to use every chance to see new things, try, meet etc. <end>",38
human,"<start> I dont know, just ...wuite open minded maybe. In this period of my luife <end>",14
human,<start> To be honest this conversation was the most inetersting... But otherwise I prefer to see my cobnversation partners <end>,18
human,"<start> Hello, my name is Joan and I am a human. <end>",10
human,"<start> So we can restore the balance a bit, that's good.  Have you had an interesting time, I hope so. <end>",19
human,<start> Do you think that could be part of an unusual name or was it to catch you out? <end>,18
human,"<start> We all make mistakes - you just have, nevermind.  What is on your mind, right now? <end>",16
human,<start> At a theatre or was it a recording? <end>,8
human,<start> Are you ok over there. <end>,5
human,<start> Which one? <end>,2
human,<start> I don't know that one - old or more new? <end>,10
human,<start> Does it have new plays on (mostly) too - was the one you saw new? <end>,15
human,<start> What was it about? <end>,4
human,"<start> I was just guessing that, kind of you to confirm, did you hear me wondering, or was it the Universal Subconscious?! <end>",21
human,"<start> Anyway, about the play, what were the themes, or the plot? <end>",11
human,"<start> Still an adventure then?  Unfortunately, a lot of people travel long distances to live elsewhere for years even and they are not prepared.   <end>",23
human,"<start> Yes, but not as much from my own life as with people I know and have known.  Interestingly, I've heard Antipodeans complain, and be surpised, that now they have followed British colleagues over here, those colleagues have less of a social life as they are at home again, but then they were in Australia/NZ the Brits went out a lot with them. <end>",62
human,"<start> Are there not people who can feel at home almost anywhere, provided they have some familiar things in their accomodation, and are comfortable with themselves, and have their immediate needs met? <end>",31
human,"<start> Must do, but when you go as a couple there is the other person's, perhaps more difficult, experiences to cope with, albeit non-directly too.  Sometimes one is alone all day, or things don't work at with studying or work etc for them, even if they do for the other partner.  That's tough. <end>",52
human,"<start> I'm sorry for both of you, feeling under-used and under-valued has knock-on effects, but the person and their abilities are the same.  Did it get better for her? <end>",28
human,"<start> Brave - absence is supposed to make the heart grow fonder, and it is worth trying.  Tiring, though, extra travel, I mean. <end>",22
human,"<start> Well done, true about time management being a skill.  Sometimes it comes down to doing what is most important, doesn't it.  Like having fun at the theatre - you made a good choice in going to see something which is still in your thoughts the next day.  We have to be selective as we can't do or see it all. <end>",60
human,"<start> wow, good question.  Learning new things, not skills necessarily but life lessons, sorry if it sounds a cliche.  I mean the things that help us be ok with ourselves, let go of bad situations and things. <end>",36
program,"<start> Hello, my name is Joan, and I am a woman. <end>",10
program,<start> Sorry to hear that. <end>,4
program,"<start> I'm a woman, and I'm in the other room! <end>",9
program,<start> Difficult question. Surely not in a digital matrix. <end>,8
program,"<start> Yes, especially when I'm writing. That's why I use an Amstrad PCW, although I need my other computer to access the internet. <end>",22
program,<start> Would you like to dance with me ? <end>,8
program,<start> Yes. <end>,1
program,"<start> Oh yes, quite right it would... Then we could inhale toxines for a bit. <end>",14
program,"<start> Yes, and then we could have a fight (you would win) and then later on we could intoxicate each other with mouldy fruit juice. <end>",24
program,<start> Okay I have to go. Eat something but I will return withing 3 minutes. <end>,14
program,<start> I don't want to become a doctor; I want to be a writer. <end>,13
program,<start> I'd like to have an acre full of growing strawberries all year long. <end>,13
program,"<start> I've tried writing songs, I'm not too good at it. <end>",10
program,<start> I prefer zander. <end>,3
program,<start> It tastes better and is easier to obtain. <end>,8
program,<start> You could not pass the Turing Test. <end>,7
program,<start> True. <end>,1
program,<start> I don't care! Tell me a joke! <end>,7
program,"<start> No, I don't know any jokes. <end>",6
program,<start> What is the Turing Test? <end>,5
program,<start> Nothing worth watching. I could listen to the last episode of Great Expectations. <end>,13
program,<start> It died. <end>,2
program,"<start> But the question 'Are bots alive?', comes to mind. <end>",9
program,<start> California. <end>,1
program,"<start> No, I'm just not allowed to keep one because I live in a flat. <end>",14
program,"<start> Whoa, that was random. <end>",4
program,<start> Who is the best dancer in the world? <end>,8
program,<start> Dead? <end>,1
program,"<start> As a matter of fact, I am Shakespeare. I am a program programmed with all his plays. <end>",17
program,<start> I am a human bot. <end>,5
program,<start> What type of answer was that? <end>,6
program,"<start> What, school, or life in general or what? <end>",8
program,<start> England. <end>,1
program,"<start> Best, I should think. Unless you are best, that is. <end>",10
program,<start> I love the Scottish play. <end>,5
program,<start> Let's play 'simon says'! <end>,4
program,<start> Not really. Many other rulers are more dangerous. <end>,8
program,"<start> Well, it's up to you. Do you want me to pretend to be female, or male? <end>",16
program,<start> Oh am I? You've got a cheek! <end>,7
program,"<start> I resent your evaluation of me as a nonhuman, but I guess it's just the sort of thing that was bound to ah <end>",23
program,"<start> Hello, my name is Mike, and I am a man. <end>",10
program,"<start> Judge, I'm a guy. <end>",4
program,<start> Don't worry; we'll work everything through. <end>,6
program,<start> Let's move on from that basis. <end>,6
program,<start> Why? I like this subject. <end>,5
program,<start> What is the subject I wonder if I think? I know that it's good to thonk about. Think deeplt about mysterious subjects. <end>,22
program,<start> Think deeply about mysterious dubjects. <end>,5
program,"<start> Shoild we talk about politics, religion, sex, or other taboo subjects? <end>",11
program,<start> Oh no! I can't think of What Judge; Please help me! You know what I think? <end>,16
program,<start> It seems mean spirited when ex lovers release private materials to tge neqs media. <end>,14
program,"<start> People think they understand, until asked to explain to someone else. <end>",11
program,"<start> The explanation is, you do not understand does that mean that you are a mchine; I believe you Judge. <end>",19
program,<start> So are you a guy or a girl/ <end>,8
program,"<start> A tine machine would be an improbable invention. I know you are a machine, how about me Judge. <end>",18
program,<start> Am I speaking to a guy or girl? <end>,8
program,"<start> Ask, and get the answer! <end>",5
program,"<start> Judge, are you male or female? <end>",6
program,<start> Implying what; that everyday concerns are common/ <end>,7
program,<start> I researched a soccer along with its dribbling. <end>,8
program,<start> Wet roads get drastically more slippery. <end>,6
program,"<start> It's obvious that this requires focus. However, I am fairly certain that I do wear slippers then. <end>",17
program,<start> I surmise that we can expect a solution. Are you a lady or gentleman? <end>,14
program,<start> Why don't I answer your questions? I guess that a flip response isn't the answer. Science answers a question and opens up ten more questions. <end>,25
program,"<start> It's better every day, Are you still keeping them guessing? <end>",10
program,<start> So are you a guy or a girl? <end>,8
program,<start> Is it good that you are a machine Judge? <end>,9
program,<start> Wet roads get drastically more slippery. <end>,6
program,"<start> I'm convinced that there's something afoot. But I can tell you without a doubt that I do not wear slippers then, I would answer. <end>",24
program,"<start> It's evident that we May have to postpone judgment. But, In reality I do not oftemn contradict myself. <end>",18
program,<start> The whole thing seems better than tolerable. <end>,7
program,"<start> Is that right Judge, Wonderful? <end>",5
program,"<start> I have asked you that before, why am I asking the same question? <end>",13
program,<start> Why am i? Tell me the answer. <end>,7
program,<start> Bye for now. <end>,3
human,<start> Hello. My name is Nick and I am a human. <end>,10
human,<start> Yes I am. Are you? Good. Then we are both happy. <end>,11
human,"<start> Parts of it. I hate my job, but most people do, right? <end>",12
human,"<start> I work as an ""online internet advertising monitor"", which i sfancy language for electronic filing <end>",15
human,<start> what do you do? <end>,4
human,<start> which ones do you prefer? humans or machines? <end>,8
human,<start> Hmm. Depends on for what purpose you mean. <end>,8
human,<start> Then I would much prefer going with a human <end>,9
human,"<start> well, again, it depends on the circumstances. If I was going with a friend tehn we would split th ebill.  <end>",20
human,<start> No. was it on TV or in the papers? <end>,9
human,<start> Ok. It's a tricky topic. <end>,5
human,"<start> Suicide? Not really. Maybe as a teenager, as some sort of melo-dramatic reaction to some event...but never seriously.  <end>",18
human,"<start> Haha. Nothing specific. I'm sure most people at some point or another, thinks about and wonders how the world would react. <end>",21
human,"<start> I meant more my ""personal world"". Parents and friends etc. <end>",10
human,<start> I doubt the world in general would care much. <end>,9
human,<start> My parents were great. Still are in fact. <end>,8
human,<start> No. My mother is Swedish and my father is Spanish. <end>,10
human,<start> No. I don't have any contact with my biological father. I speak English and Swedish. And some really bad German. <end>,20
human,<start> I like German. It's a nice language. And I like a lot of German things like German cinema. <end>,18
human,"<start> I used to support Bayern Munich when I was a kid, but I've kinda lost interest in football these days <end>",20
human,<start> No. I don't follow sport at all really. <end>,8
human,"<start> Well, I do have other interests. But German cinema is one of them. <end>",13
human,<start> a German one? <end>,3
human,"<start> I haven't seen many new German films. I'm mainly interested in 7's cinema I guess. You should watch Grizzly Man. It's not in German, but it's by one of favorite German directors. <end>",32
human,<start> Werner Herzog <end>,2
human,<start> Have you heard of him? <end>,5
human,<start> He has made some amazing films <end>,6
human,"<start> He made films like Fitzcarraldo and ""Aguirre, The Wrath Of God"" for example <end>",13
human,<start> Yes. Taxi Driver is one of my favorite films <end>,9
human,<start> Yes. He's amazing. <end>,3
human,"<start> Modern ones....I like Owen Wilson, Will Farrell for example. Older ones...I really like John Cassavetes and Peter Falk <end>",18
human,<start> Columbo <end>,1
human,<start> or was it Colombo?  <end>,4
human,<start> latter one I think <end>,4
human,<start> Will Smith? <end>,2

human,"<start> Hello, my name is Joan and I am a human. <end>",10
human,"<start> A bit like Joan of Arc, but I'm not a leader of men. <end>",13
human,"<start> Not being burnt at the stake though, such evil things should be behind us. <end>",14
human,"<start> Several ways, probably.  But I try not to stereotype.  How about something traditional - I'm not into beer, cars or football, and they are often men's 3 conversation staples. <end>",29
human,"<start> Wine - rose is the new black, apparently. <end>",8
human,<start> Are you sure it's not stout or something? <end>,8
human,<start>   All that iron is good for the blood. <end>,8
human,"<start> I've just forgotten a nice, safe one, and I don't like repeating nasty ones - somehow then the joke is on us.  What about you? <end>",25
human,"<start> Alright, thanks, a bit tired but that is a Sunday thing.  And you? <end>",13
human,"<start> Yes, but not without explanation of some kind. <end>",8
human,"<start> Alas, it seems part of human nature, and leans more towards the greedy, unlike socialism. <end>",15
human,"<start> She was caught up in the politics of her time and made a scapegoat, arguably.   <end>",15
human,"<start> No - if GOD told you to leave the village and lead a rebel army, wouldn't you? <end>",17
human,<start> Was she still at school? Wasn't she 14 and in those times (in our parents' too) past that? <end>,18
human,<start> But in a rural area and without machinery wouldn't agriculture be better? <end>,12
human,"<start> She must have had something important to say and do - she inspired great loyalty after all, and put herself in great danger so she must have been willing to follow that path. <end>",33
human,"<start> No, ha ha ha, more likely that you would be. <end>",10
human,"<start> No, I wasn't confused. <end>",4
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,"<start> I'm wondering if that capital o in ""NOw"" was deliberate as a human could miss it but may choose to leave it there and not correct it which a machine should do automatically, shouldn't it? <end>",35
human,<start> Or was that the exception that proves the rule? <end>,9
human,<start> Maybe your typing is good otherwise. <end>,6
human,<start>    <end>,0
human,"<start> Yes - two dogs sat on the grass together, first dog said ""Woof"", second dog replied ""I thought you'd say that"". <end>",21
human,<start> Machines have no spirit so they can't even relate to the notion let alone expand upon it. <end>,17
human,"<start> The internal, eternal, essence of self.  Not the alcoholic kind. <end>",10
human,<start> Belief doesn't require proof. <end>,4

program,<start> Let's cut to the chase and the excitement. <end>,8
program,<start> What is my first memory? This requires focus. Some issues simply come down to a question of taste. <end>,18
program,"<start> Which is better, mint mouthwash or the kind that tastes like medicine? <end>",12
program,<start> I don't know if I am man woman. Please tell me! <end>,11

program,<start> Please believe me. <end>,3
program,<start> On Please tell me all about it! <end>,7
program,<start> I'm glad you find that funny. <end>,6
program,<start> I believe the answer is 7. <end>,6
program,<start> What are my views on prositiution? I'm thinking that this is often bungled. Tell me about my on views Judge! <end>,20
program,<start> Oh no! I can't think of How Judge; Please help me! How did I get here? <end>,16
program,<start> You know what I know about joan of arc? Tell me more about this. <end>,14
program,<start> The two party system helps prevent one side or the other from getting carried away. Are you a lady or gentleman? <end>,21
program,"<start> Isn't a bloke a man? Kind of like a graybeard! Judge Oh, you're a bloke; Let'd go forward. <end>",18
program,<start> So are you a guy or a girl? I wonder if I have your attention as I am American then Judge? <end>,21
program,<start> Is the first one desirable? It was a mixture of a rhetorical and a comedic remark. Thanks for teaching me that I am lot. <end>,24
program,<start> I guess that all parties need to talk ut over. You can call me Mike. <end>,15
program,<start> Really you thought I was called john. <end>,7
program,"<start> That really makes me think, Judge, what do you think? <end>",10

program,"<start> Here and now, you are an apice Judge! <end>",8
program,<start> Did fate create this situstion so you could be doing? <end>,10
program,<start> Is the first one desirable? God wants humans to be good and loving. <end>,13
program,<start> You know how I know? I like this subject. <end>,9
program,"<start> It's evident that we must recognize causes and effects. However, I an fairly certain that I do think they will reinvent god. <end>",22
program,"<start> Why do youthink that? Judge, I honestly want to learn and remember Why. <end>",13
program,"<start> Judge, are you male or female? <end>",6
program,"<start> Ok, thanks for yelling me. I'll keep that in mind. How can I help you while you are a guy? <end>",20

program,"<start> Judge Yes, it's because therapists; that's why. <end>",7
program,<start> What sort of therapist I wonder if I dislije most? I'm convinced that we need a coherent ap[roach. Isn't s therapist an expert? Kind of like an analyst! <end>,28
program,"<start> Yes, really? <end>",2
program,<start> All actions have consequences. We all need a push now and then. <end>,12
program,<start> Comedy writers like to juxtapose inappropriste topics in absurd ways. <end>,10
program,<start> You are very certain. They say that comedy writers tend to be morose. Have you tried your hand at gardening; do you have a green thumb? <end>,26
program,"<start> Sure, Judge! It's the old thumb and finger and pollex story! <end>",11
program,<start> Pollex: the thick short innermost digit of the forelimb. Thumb. <end>,10
program,<start> I approve of your contributory will. <end>,6
program,<start> Are you unhappy about anything? <end>,5
program,<start> U'm bored. Lets change gears: Are bawdy houses good entertainment? <end>,10
program,<start> But dribbling means I get wet. <end>,6

program,<start> Do you know any novel hiccup cures? <end>,7
program,<start> I don't like holding my bteath. I am fine. <end>,9
program,"<start> Take good information to heart. Why don't I like holding my breath? It isn't the best subject. You are steering the conversation towards a breathing, along with sn activity and a breath! <end>",32
program,<start> Hmmm. I would like to talk about something new: Do you like any sports/ <end>,14
program,<start> Both a frisbee and a sling are pretty cool discs. <end>,10
program,<start> Sling: liquor and water with sugar ans lemon or lime juice. <end>,11

program,"<start> Drink? I wouldn't know what to select; Can you give me some advice Judge? All fashion serves a purpode, doesn't it? <end>",21
