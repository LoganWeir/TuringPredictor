human,<start> Hello. My name is John and I'm a human.
human,<start> Hi there.
human,<start> I'm fine thanks. How are you?
human,<start> Same here. It's not often I get up this early on Sundays
human,<start> On Sundays? Or just in general?
human,<start> I work part-time for a ma BackSpace  BackSpace market-re BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  research company
human,<start> It most definitely is NOT fun
human,<start> But it pays the bills
human,"<start> Not really. I would like to do more hours, but there isn't enough work. I work 4 days a week, so it's almost full-time"
human,<start> and it's quite nice to always have 3-day weekends
human,"<start> I don't really do any of the reseacrh BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace rch. I think my official title is ""online advertising monitor"""
human,<start> the company deals with inter  BackSpace net audience statistics etc
human,<start> I pretty much just click on banner ads all day
human,<start> very repetitive
human,<start> but it's a nice company and the hours are very flexible
human,<start> I can see that.
human,"<start> Well, that's tricky. I'm  a BackSpace  BackSpace a big film buff so it's hard for me to pick one BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace just one."
human,"<start> One of favorite ""modern"" films is Gummo"
human,<start> ye BackSpace up
human,<start> What's your favorite film?
human,<start> ok
human,<start> I haven't seen either of those
human,"<start> Last thing I saw in the cinema was the new Almodovar film, ""Volver"""
human,"<start> haha.  She's very good in it. The film itself...hmm...well, I don't know, really. I liked it, but then it didn't really do much for me."
human,<start> haha
human,<start> Worth seeing anyway
human,"<start> Yeah. It was good, but I wouldn't want to see it again."
human,<start> Really? M BackSpace I can watch my favorite films on repeat and never get tirwe BackSpace  BackSpace ed of them.
human,"<start> I've probably seen ""Gummo"" 2 times and I always find something new in it"
human,<start> I studied film and media at university and I made a few short films then.
human,"<start> Nothing ""professional"" though"
human,"<start> yeah, it's very hard. I haven't done anything in ages. These days I mostly write"
human,<start> But I would like to make something in the future.;  BackSpace  BackSpace  I have a few ideas that would  BackSpace n't be too difficult to pull off.
human,<start> Hmm. I would probably just stick to doing it with friends.
human,<start> haha. Exactly.
human,<start> what was it?
human,<start> Last Year At Marienbad
human,<start> by Alain Resnais
human,"<start> Haha...it's just a stunning film. It's so beautiful to just look at. Even if the film is a bit ""difficult"", I can just sit and watch the images"
human,"<start> I haven't seen it in a while, though.  BackSpace  I have it on DVd."
human,"<start> But, it's a about memory...and memory is a weird thing"
human,<start> Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind?
human,"<start> I really likled  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace ed it in the cinema, but when I saw it t BackSpace a second time I couldn't stand it"
human,"<start> Well, it's more interesting than most things that's rel;eased anyway"
human,<start> at least it makes you think a little
human,<start> I'm not really interested in politics  BackSpace  at all
human,<start> If  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace yes I do
human,"<start> I think I voted New Labour last time. lesser of two evils, I guess"
human,<start> True
human,<start> Probably just watch d BackSpace some Dvd BackSpace  BackSpace VDs with my girlfriend
human,"<start> No, I just own a lot"
human,<start> but her flatmate is signed up to lovefilm
human,<start> haha. which one?
human,"<start> well, he seems to have good taste"
human,<start> yup. you too. have a good day

human,"<start> no, in BackSpace  like to choose the music myself"
human,<start> i hate when someone else is telling me what i am going o listen to

human,<start> sometimes i listen to classical music
human,<start> that depends on what i am feeling like at the moment
human,"<start> vivaldi, mozart, straus"
human,"<start> though i hate chaykovsky, whatever you spell his name"
human,<start> \ BackSpace Don Carlos or Magical Fleut BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace or Tocsa BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace sca

human,"<start> kind, polite, consi BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace respectful"
human,<start> let me think

human,<start> you mean his last game?
human,"<start> i didn't BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace yes, it was emotional, he is a great player and that was the end of a great carrer"
