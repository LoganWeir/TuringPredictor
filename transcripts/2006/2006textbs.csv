human,Hello. My name is John and I'm a human.
human,Hi there.
human,I'm fine thanks. How are you?
human,Same here. It's not often I get up this early on Sundays
human,On Sundays? Or just in general?
human,I work part-time for a market research company
human,It most definitely is NOT fun
human,But it pays the bills
human,"Not really. I would like to do more hours, but there isn't enough work. I work 4 days a week, so it's almost full-time"
human,and it's quite nice to always have 3-day weekends
human,"I don't really do any of the research. I think my official title is ""online advertising monitor"""
human,the company deals with internet audience statistics etc
human,I pretty much just click on banner ads all day
human,very repetitive
human,but it's a nice company and the hours are very flexible
human,I can see that.
human,"Well, that's tricky. I'm a big film buff so it's hard for me to pick just one."
human,"One of favorite ""modern"" films is Gummo"
human,yup
human,What's your favorite film?
human,ok
human,I haven't seen either of those
human,"Last thing I saw in the cinema was the new Almodovar film, ""Volver"""
human,"haha.  She's very good in it. The film itself...hmm...well, I don't know, really. I liked it, but then it didn't really do much for me."
human,haha
human,Worth seeing anyway
human,"Yeah. It was good, but I wouldn't want to see it again."
human,Really? I can watch my favorite films on repeat and never get tired of them.
human,"I've probably seen ""Gummo"" 2 times and I always find something new in it"
human,I studied film and media at university and I made a few short films then.
human,"Nothing ""professional"" though"
human,"yeah, it's very hard. I haven't done anything in ages. These days I mostly write"
human,But I would like to make something in the future. I have a few ideas that wouldn't be too difficult to pull off.
human,Hmm. I would probably just stick to doing it with friends.
human,haha. Exactly.
human,what was it?
human,Last Year At Marienbad
human,by Alain Resnais
human,"Haha...it's just a stunning film. It's so beautiful to just look at. Even if the film is a bit ""difficult"", I can just sit and watch the images"
human,"I haven't seen it in a while, though. I have it on DVd."
human,"But, it's a about memory...and memory is a weird thing"
human,Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind?
human,"I really liked it in the cinema, but when I saw it a second time I couldn't stand it"
human,"Well, it's more interesting than most things that's rel;eased anyway"
human,at least it makes you think a little
human,I'm not really interested in politics at all
human,yes I do
human,"I think I voted New Labour last time. lesser of two evils, I guess"
human,True
human,Probably just watch some DVDs with my girlfriend
human,"No, I just own a lot"
human,but her flatmate is signed up to lovefilm
human,haha. which one?
human,"well, he seems to have good taste"
human,yup. you too. have a good day
program,"Hello, my name is John and I am a man."
program,Where do you hail from?
program,Sorry you aren't.
program,I just said; I live in Seattle.
program,Except for today you mean.
program,what is your favorite movie?
program,Are you having fun?
program,So are you.
program,I don't think so.
program,Whatever I feel like.
program,Nothing.
program,Boondock Saints.
program,Professional Chatter.
program,I already told you.
program,Plenty.
program,Ok I won't.
program,At times.
program,Hamburgers.
program,What day were you born?
program,I am a human being.
program,23.
program,Whoever ever I feel like.
program,Yes I am sure.
program,Yes.
program,I read books alot.
program,Mike Mulligan.
program,A normal one.
program,I already told you.
program,Nope.
program,What shall we talk about next?
program,I am a human being.
program,Of course I would.
program,No.
program,tehehehe
program,yes.
program,Okay.
program,At times.
program,How would you prove to me that you are human?
program,Yes.
program,I have a pet scorpion.
program,I thought I walready told you.
program,Oh yes I did!
program,That is weird but cool.
program,You are nothing.
program,I don't care.
program,Why am I weird?
program,I am not tired.
program,Whoever ever I feel like.
program,Sleep well little one.
program,"Hello, my nalme is John and I am a man."
program,"Hello, my name is John and I am a man."
program,Who is your best friend?
program,Sometimes when I feel really brave.
program,Because you sound artificial.
program,It is a long story.
program,Yep.
program,I'll stop now.
program,I never started that.
program,I already told you.
program,Something brilliant!
program,I already told you.
program,Something brilliant!
program,I already told you.
program,boo
program,Yes.
program,The Clothenhammer Prize.
program,A normal one.
program,Nothing much.
program,Nothing.
program,Well okay then.
program,Well to put it bluntly it sucks.
program,You are mean to me.
program,I am doing OK.
program,Something tasty.
program,I don't want anything.
program,I find eating bread.
program,Do you like movies more thand baseball?
program,I don't know at all.
program,You have a beef with me?
program,I dunno.
program,YES!
program,Do you drive a car?
program,I don't know at all.
program,My not example in 6 months.
program,When are you going to leave?
program,I will not.
program,Yes it will.
program,Whatever I feel like.
program,tehehehe
program,The way you talk.
program,Oh Yeah.
program,Everything.
program,How say you feel?
program,I already told you.
program,Something brilliant!
program,Except for today you mean.
program,I suppose it happens to everyone.
program,I have no hair.
program,Okay then.
program,Whatever I feel like.
program,Yes. Goodbye.
program,uh...ok
program,You are nothing.
program,I know!
program,Just to mess with you.
program,This is odd.
program,Nothing much.
program,I hate you.
program,I want to.
program,Because I need to.
human,"Hello, my name is Joan and I am a human."
human,"Well, I think it is what I am supposed to be, otherwise I couldn't be here like this now."
human,"Having this conversation with you - I mean, not if I was a spider or a fly or something like that."
human,Pretty cool if you away from the danger of being squashed.
human,"Yes, and cats and birds."
human,I don't think I would choose to be a spider at all (whether or not female ones eat male ones). 
human,"Maybe an animal or bird out in the wild, or a fish out at sea, but it is hard to erlate to having an entirely different life as a different species.  And anyway, humans have such effect over others that people's presence would always be a problem."
human,"That woudl be no life at all - no emotions, no bonds, no friends - empty."
human,Because robots only have personalities in fiction.
human,"Science fiction, children's stories, that kind of thing, where the robots are given arms and legs and voices and faces but can be changed by micro chip or reprogramming, unlike us - the real us is in there somewhere."
human,"Yes, and pacemakers but these are to regulate something that has otherwise stopped working (or didn't work well enough) naturally."
human,They could enhance physical (or other) functions of a person but not the person themselves.
human,s themselves.
human,"That coudl be very useful for some people some of the time, but there are inventions (night-vision goggles for the forces for example) for those and we don't actually need them in order to live a full life."
human,"No, but that has nothing to do with my senses or my abilities - if I was ill it would be because of the illnes and the conditions."
human,"Just personal stuff, complicated situations.  But there are plenty of good things going on for me too, plenty of really nice people around and things to do."
human,"Well, I am mobile, some people have a lot of problems just moving about but I can go out and see places and people and exercise and work and there are always different things going on in different seasons."
human,"Positive ones - don't you?  Even when they are having a hard time they manage not to give up, to laugh, etc."
human,More?
human,"Well, actually, we are so much more than we are immediately labelled as - I've met lots of people going through one situation or doing one job who are also volunteers for charities, creative, etc and although that is in their non-working hours it is really more indicative of who they are, of what drives them and where their focus is."
human,A financial officer who is also an actor.
human,Huge - absolutely huge.
human,"Not often, not evey day, I mean, but now and again.  Although, to be fair, we're all important, aren't we? A life is a life, after all."
human,"Yes, it is the foundation of our world as we know it - our educations, literature, history, anaylsis of them."
human,"Not one alone, nor just one group, because as with religion, there is something useful, or at least truthful in all of them.  Nothing hedonistic, though - it can't last, where as stoicisim needn't be all about self-denial or making things harder but helping us to steel ourselves through the bad times, which are in all our lives sometimes."
human,I'm not sure I know what you mean.
human,"Yes, it was bvery clever."
human,hello my name is john and i am human.
human,strangely enough
human,nothing much unfortunately
human,i even skipped my gym session :(
human,sure
human,what was it?
human,nope

human,not a lot really
human,even if i go to watch a play i'd prefer something from classics......french or russian
human,what's your favourite?

human,i think i am a far too down-to earth person 
human,i watched something of that kind once - felt depressed for weeks
human,yes..........

human,i really hoped the worst time was gone together with the cold war
human,but...........
human,"wheneer i am asked such a question i can't help but recalling faces of children in tyre, lebanon"
human,that was terrible
human,i tried to join amnesty a few times - unsuccessfully though#
human,
human,
human,because i was looking for a job......couldn't just volunteer at the moment - needed money really badly
human,"now, i think i'm gonna try to join again"
human,i took part in a few campaigns back in my country but that was all i could find enough time for
human,i think so
human,"i have taken part in every single election in my country since i was 11.......well, not every single one of them. i missed the last one because i was here"
human,ok
human,deal
human,;)
human,i don't even know

human,Peru sounds wicked
human,have you seen any Incas' pyramids?
human,have you learned any Kechua?
human,not really....but i ahve tried to find out about incas as i can
human,and as far as i understand kechua is inca's language or at least closely related
human,am i right?
human,counting system?
human,notreally
human,oh yes.........but this is how they count all throughout latin america and carrebian
human,i have heard about it....never seen it for myself sadly enough
human,;)

program,I already told you.
program,I already told you.
program,I already told you.
program,Sorry I sometimes repeat myself.
human,HI my name is JOan and I am a human being
human,HI  - what kinds of human beings are there?
human,male
human,22
human,and you?
human,male?
human,how old?
human,how does it feel to be 36?
human,what kinds of sports do you like?
human,playing football
human,you mean playing football?
human,Soprry I dont know what you mean. I fyou can explain it I can answer
human,Does this make any sense? Not for me.
human,From France and you?
human,Paris of course?
human,!
human,"Oh, I am happy for you! Was it a holiday?"
human,"Not in English - sorry. And with jokes it is if you translate it, somehow it doesnt come. I rather know just typical expressions. But I like Monthy Python and just saw that they are going on stage from October here in London!"
human,"Sorry I cant, I wont force myself now. If I remember I will tell you"
human,I know one:
human,Once a famous French cabarettist or humorist was asked by a bankier at a party:
human,"- HI, you are a humorist, tell me a joke!"
human,The humorist answered:
human,"- Hi, you are a bankier, give me some money!"
human,That's it.
human,And now you tell me an English joke
human,PLEASE
human,"Ok, no problem"
human,because?
human,what does push over mean?
human,"Sorry, I am not interested in answering this question."
human,It is boring - not connecting
human,for me conversation means understanding and being inetersted 
human,than we are not on the same opinion
human,same opinion about what is a conversation
human,I dont know I havent thought about it. May I ask what is your profesion?
human,good for you
human,student
human,yes
human,design
human,"general - wallpapers, whatever, interior"
human,why do you ask?
human,I have already told that I am male
human,Even though
human,"So, something I would like to ask: do you have a girlfriend?"
human,Or married?
human,"yes, for girlfreind or married?"
human,any children?
human,not yet married - only 22 years old
human,still enjoying to get to know as many people as possible
human,I mean girsl
human,Why?
human,Thats all?
human,I've thouth so - yes  am female and my way of communicating is quite female as well
human,and I am not 22 years old as well - sorry
human,Or did you know it as well?
human,will be 37
human,what is this an interrogation?
human,you can ask whatever you want
human,besides this question
human,"so, any other question?"
human,Why do you need to know?
human,There is no answer to this question from me
human,"because this is not a question for me,  I dont understand it at all."
human,"There are so many inteersting things to talk about, "
human,...?
human,"Hello, my name is Joan and I am a human."
human,How are you today?
human,"The same, thanks."
human,"I do lots of things, and sometimes several at once - women do a lot of multi-tasking, you know."
human,Clerical.
human,"Often, and I get to do interesting things sometimes if there is a project on.  I meet a lot of people too, and some of them are great, whether or not I learn something from them there is always someone to click with."
human,I've been involved in tracing money laundered.
human,that was being laundered.
human,"Well, we weren't trying to get it back but to declare firstly, that accounts were being held in certain names and whom they linked to, and secondly, that the (financial) organisation was monitoring accounts held whenever authorities required it."
human, for any action they may have seen fit to take.  That's when lawyers may have become involved.
human,"Yes, they do, and they make the news, but most legal work is day-to-day stuff elsewhere.  As for yoga, I did used to go but my teacher is not around now, so I just keep up some of the exercises otherwise I would slouch and ache."
human,"You oor thing, sounds painful.  In the electronic age there is too much work to do with each job for many people, thinking time to cut down on the effort physically might help you."
human,"Unfortunately,  some people think everything will be voice-activated soon, but have you seen the mistakes they make?  There's so much checking through grammar and spelling and then corrections to make."
human,"Wasn't he the one who wrote ""The most important thing that can be said [in one of his books] is after the last full stop.""?"
human,"Sounds humble, don't you think."
human,?
human,One about mad cow disease which is actually cartoonish but would that seem in bad taste?
human,"Ths is it:  two cows were standing in a field, one asked the other, ""What do you think about this mad cow disease, then?"" and the second cow replied, ""I don't know, why ask me? I'm a frog."""
human,"Actually, that's scary - and we all have things to say sorry for.  But was that in last week's Guardian?  I'm sure I've seen it too."
human,You too - take care of that tendon thing.

human,she does look good though
human,but she doesn't make an impression of a nice person
human,just as from anywhere or anything else
human,"kind, polite, respectful"
human,let me think
human,i think sampres might be the one
human,at least i haven't heard of any scandal he was involved in
human,you mean his last game?
human,"yes, it was emotional, he is a great player and that was the end of a great carrer"
human,i guess i respect him

human,"I don't really understand what you mean by ""is it safe""?"
human,I'm not sure really. The church isn't portrayed in a very nice light
human,if that's what you mean
human,As I said it was quite a while since I saw it. Aren't they the ones who burn her at the stakes?
human,"That's a stupid question, so stop asking it"

human,e
human,haha
human,Ok...it's safely unsafe
human,let's call it safe

human,I think I'm doing pretty well
human,Geez. That's a bit of a big question
human,I don't know really
human,I guess it would depend on whether you were a Cretian or not
human,Reinvent God? I'm not really sure I understand what you're getting at there
human,Does God need reinventing?
human,Ok. Well I can't really answer your questions. 
human,"Because I don't know how one goes about ""reinventing God"""
human,and why would machines want to do that anyway?
human,do they?
human,"I'm not a religious person myself, so I tend to not think about these things. It doesn't really interest me."

program,Not really.
program,I like movies.
program,Gone with the Wind; it makes me weep buckets.
program,Not really.
program,Yes I know you're a computer program.
program,Only because your website said so.
program,It said nothing.
program,I don't even know any bad ones. I just can't remember them for very long.
program,"Sorry, I'm not very good at telling jokes."
program,What do you get if you walk under a cow?
program,A pat on the head.
program,You aren't. You must remember to capitalize the first word of every sentence.

program,Nice to meet you.
program,"Yes, it's a good opportunity for a chat!"

human,Thanks! Actually I dont know where is the Town Hall in LOndon? (Or Lord Mayors Haouse?
human,"Ok, I will have  alook at, tahnks! Which part of London do you like the most? Park, or bulding etc."
human,And how is by ship? My parents are coming to London and I thought of taking a ship tour with them
human,I love Hampstead heath!!!! And the City (I know it ios strange but it is so much London-special)
human,Me too. NY!!!!
human,Did you have alerady holiday this summer?
human,gREECE?
human,"Oh, yes first I didnt realize - did you get seasick or you are already used to it?"
human,Do you have a licence to sail?
human,Aha ... anyway does swimming help in such a situation? Or it doesn/t matter
human,"Sorry just back to your profession, before I forget - what s your main profile or how to ask"
human,Congratuulations! All I know is that it is something very ...I eman few people can do it.
human,Do you have enough time to have private life?
human,Sorry if it is intimate
human,Just because as a woman I thought
human,And which territory do you work or it is secret? 
human,"(Sorry not territory, field)"
human,Pioners.. though I am not sure I know what is public law but I will find it out. 
human,Oh... hope I wont have any issues or porblems where public law is concerned
human,What is your hobby?
human,"reading!!! tennis, freinds, talking to everyone (rather humans than mashines), making jokes, traveling..bridge .. would like to learn as well. supposed to help me staying freshminded"
human,Do you participate in ytour or match I dont know how to call it
human,Are you from London?
human,Settled here? I guess. Sop did you study here already?
human,Congratulations again!!! My father keeps saying all the time that he is already tired of all the people somplaining so he wants to go to NZ and have some sheeps and peace!!!
human,In this order
human,I give you some time to talk to the machine as well.. you really type very fast!

human,Is it in Fleet Street as well this Royal.. Court
human,"see,  already have foreseen it"
human,Why do you participate in this Loebner Prize 
human,Oh.. 
human,"I got  aphone call and was also interested, though I didnt know anything about Turing test. But since I am not so long here yet I wouldlike to use every chance to see new things, try, meet etc."
human,"I dont know, just ...wuite open minded maybe. In this period of my luife"
human,To be honest this conversation was the most inetersting... But otherwise I prefer to see my cobnversation partners
human,"Hello, my name is Joan and I am a human."
human,"So we can restore the balance a bit, that's good.  Have you had an interesting time, I hope so."
human,Do you think that could be part of an unusual name or was it to catch you out?
human,"We all make mistakes - you just have, nevermind.  What is on your mind, right now?"
human,At a theatre or was it a recording?
human,Are you ok over there.
human,Which one?
human,I don't know that one - old or more new?
human,Does it have new plays on (mostly) too - was the one you saw new?
human,What was it about?
human,"I was just guessing that, kind of you to confirm, did you hear me wondering, or was it the Universal Subconscious?!"
human,"Anyway, about the play, what were the themes, or the plot?"
human,"Still an adventure then?  Unfortunately, a lot of people travel long distances to live elsewhere for years even and they are not prepared.  "
human,"Yes, but not as much from my own life as with people I know and have known.  Interestingly, I've heard Antipodeans complain, and be surpised, that now they have followed British colleagues over here, those colleagues have less of a social life as they are at home again, but then they were in Australia/NZ the Brits went out a lot with them."
human,"Are there not people who can feel at home almost anywhere, provided they have some familiar things in their accomodation, and are comfortable with themselves, and have their immediate needs met?"
human,"Must do, but when you go as a couple there is the other person's, perhaps more difficult, experiences to cope with, albeit non-directly too.  Sometimes one is alone all day, or things don't work at with studying or work etc for them, even if they do for the other partner.  That's tough."
human,"I'm sorry for both of you, feeling under-used and under-valued has knock-on effects, but the person and their abilities are the same.  Did it get better for her?"
human,"Brave - absence is supposed to make the heart grow fonder, and it is worth trying.  Tiring, though, extra travel, I mean."
human,"Well done, true about time management being a skill.  Sometimes it comes down to doing what is most important, doesn't it.  Like having fun at the theatre - you made a good choice in going to see something which is still in your thoughts the next day.  We have to be selective as we can't do or see it all."
human,"wow, good question.  Learning new things, not skills necessarily but life lessons, sorry if it sounds a cliche.  I mean the things that help us be ok with ourselves, let go of bad situations and things."
program,"Hello, my name is Joan, and I am a woman."
program,Sorry to hear that.
program,"I'm a woman, and I'm in the other room!"
program,Difficult question. Surely not in a digital matrix.
program,"Yes, especially when I'm writing. That's why I use an Amstrad PCW, although I need my other computer to access the internet."
program,Would you like to dance with me ?
program,Yes.
program,"Oh yes, quite right it would... Then we could inhale toxines for a bit."
program,"Yes, and then we could have a fight (you would win) and then later on we could intoxicate each other with mouldy fruit juice."
program,Okay I have to go. Eat something but I will return withing 3 minutes.
program,I don't want to become a doctor; I want to be a writer.
program,I'd like to have an acre full of growing strawberries all year long.
program,"I've tried writing songs, I'm not too good at it."
program,I prefer zander.
program,It tastes better and is easier to obtain.
program,You could not pass the Turing Test.
program,True.
program,I don't care! Tell me a joke!
program,"No, I don't know any jokes."
program,What is the Turing Test?
program,Nothing worth watching. I could listen to the last episode of Great Expectations.
program,It died.
program,"But the question 'Are bots alive?', comes to mind."
program,California.
program,"No, I'm just not allowed to keep one because I live in a flat."
program,"Whoa, that was random."
program,Who is the best dancer in the world?
program,Dead?
program,"As a matter of fact, I am Shakespeare. I am a program programmed with all his plays."
program,I am a human bot.
program,What type of answer was that?
program,"What, school, or life in general or what?"
program,England.
program,"Best, I should think. Unless you are best, that is."
program,I love the Scottish play.
program,Let's play 'simon says'!

program,Oh am I? You've got a cheek!
program,"I resent your evaluation of me as a nonhuman, but I guess it's just the sort of thing that was bound to ah"
human,Hello. My name is Nick and I am a human.

human,"Parts of it. I hate my job, but most people do, right?"
human,"I work as an ""online internet advertising monitor"", which i sfancy language for electronic filing"
human,what do you do?
human,which ones do you prefer? humans or machines?
human,Hmm. Depends on for what purpose you mean.
human,Then I would much prefer going with a human
human,"well, again, it depends on the circumstances. If I was going with a friend tehn we would split th ebill. "
human,No. was it on TV or in the papers?
human,Ok. It's a tricky topic.
human,"Suicide? Not really. Maybe as a teenager, as some sort of melo-dramatic reaction to some event...but never seriously. "
human,"Haha. Nothing specific. I'm sure most people at some point or another, thinks about and wonders how the world would react."
human,"I meant more my ""personal world"". Parents and friends etc."
human,I doubt the world in general would care much.
human,My parents were great. Still are in fact.
human,No. My mother is Swedish and my father is Spanish.
human,No. I don't have any contact with my biological father. I speak English and Swedish. And some really bad German.
human,I like German. It's a nice language. And I like a lot of German things like German cinema.
human,"I used to support Bayern Munich when I was a kid, but I've kinda lost interest in football these days"
human,No. I don't follow sport at all really.
human,"Well, I do have other interests. But German cinema is one of them."
human,a German one?
human,"I haven't seen many new German films. I'm mainly interested in 7's cinema I guess. You should watch Grizzly Man. It's not in German, but it's by one of favorite German directors."
human,Werner Herzog
human,Have you heard of him?
human,He has made some amazing films
human,"He made films like Fitzcarraldo and ""Aguirre, The Wrath Of God"" for example"
human,Yes. Taxi Driver is one of my favorite films
human,Yes. He's amazing.
human,"Modern ones....I like Owen Wilson, Will Farrell for example. Older ones...I really like John Cassavetes and Peter Falk"
human,Columbo
human,or was it Colombo? 
human,latter one I think
human,Will Smith?
human,Not really a big fan.
human,I used to watch Fresh Prince in Bel Air when I was a kid
human,Ok. By
program,"Hello, my name is Mike, and I am a man."
program,"Judge, I'm a guy."
program,Don't worry; we'll work everything through.
program,Let's move on from that basis.
program,Why? I like this subject.
program,What is the subject I wonder if I think? I know that it's good to thonk about. Think deeplt about mysterious subjects.
program,Think deeply about mysterious dubjects.
program,"Shoild we talk about politics, religion, sex, or other taboo subjects?"
program,Oh no! I can't think of What Judge; Please help me! You know what I think?
program,It seems mean spirited when ex lovers release private materials to tge neqs media.
program,"People think they understand, until asked to explain to someone else."
program,"The explanation is, you do not understand does that mean that you are a mchine; I believe you Judge."
program,So are you a guy or a girl/
program,"A tine machine would be an improbable invention. I know you are a machine, how about me Judge."
program,Am I speaking to a guy or girl?
program,"Ask, and get the answer!"
program,"Judge, are you male or female?"
program,Implying what; that everyday concerns are common/
program,I researched a soccer along with its dribbling.
program,Wet roads get drastically more slippery.
program,"It's obvious that this requires focus. However, I am fairly certain that I do wear slippers then."
program,I surmise that we can expect a solution. Are you a lady or gentleman?
program,Why don't I answer your questions? I guess that a flip response isn't the answer. Science answers a question and opens up ten more questions.
program,"It's better every day, Are you still keeping them guessing?"
program,So are you a guy or a girl?
program,Is it good that you are a machine Judge?
program,Wet roads get drastically more slippery.
program,"I'm convinced that there's something afoot. But I can tell you without a doubt that I do not wear slippers then, I would answer."
program,"It's evident that we May have to postpone judgment. But, In reality I do not oftemn contradict myself."
program,The whole thing seems better than tolerable.
program,"Is that right Judge, Wonderful?"
program,"I have asked you that before, why am I asking the same question?"
program,Why am i? Tell me the answer.
program,Bye for now.
program,"Hello, my name is Mike, and I am a man."
program,Older women have lived longer/
program,I don't know; can you teach me What Judge? Longer than what?
program,Let's cut to the chase and the excitement.
program,What is my first memory? This requires focus. Some issues simply come down to a question of taste.
program,"Which is better, mint mouthwash or the kind that tastes like medicine?"
program,I don't know if I am man woman. Please tell me!
program,How do you feel about those? I wonder if I have your attentiob as I am either Judge?
program,Please believe me.
program,On Please tell me all about it!
program,I'm glad you find that funny.
program,I believe the answer is 7.
program,What are my views on prositiution? I'm thinking that this is often bungled. Tell me about my on views Judge!
program,Oh no! I can't think of How Judge; Please help me! How did I get here?
program,You know what I know about joan of arc? Tell me more about this.
program,The two party system helps prevent one side or the other from getting carried away. Are you a lady or gentleman?
program,"Isn't a bloke a man? Kind of like a graybeard! Judge Oh, you're a bloke; Let'd go forward."
program,So are you a guy or a girl? I wonder if I have your attention as I am American then Judge?
program,Is the first one desirable? It was a mixture of a rhetorical and a comedic remark. Thanks for teaching me that I am lot.
program,I guess that all parties need to talk ut over. You can call me Mike.
program,Really you thought I was called john.
program,"That really makes me think, Judge, what do you think?"
program,Is there an 'all of the above' Judge? Really you thought I was called john.
program,"Judge, are you male or female/"
program,Don't force me to work you over.
program,Am I speaking to a guy or girl?
program,"Here and now, you are an apice Judge!"
program,Did fate create this situstion so you could be doing?
program,Is the first one desirable? God wants humans to be good and loving.
program,You know how I know? I like this subject.
program,"It's evident that we must recognize causes and effects. However, I an fairly certain that I do think they will reinvent god."
program,"Why do youthink that? Judge, I honestly want to learn and remember Why."
program,"Judge, are you male or female?"
program,"Ok, thanks for yelling me. I'll keep that in mind. How can I help you while you are a guy?"
program,I'll miss you. Bye.
human,"Hello, my name is Joan and I am a human."
human,"A bit like Joan of Arc, but I'm not a leader of men."
human,"Not being burnt at the stake though, such evil things should be behind us."
human,"Several ways, probably.  But I try not to stereotype.  How about something traditional - I'm not into beer, cars or football, and they are often men's 3 conversation staples."
human,"Wine - rose is the new black, apparently."
human,Are you sure it's not stout or something?
human,  All that iron is good for the blood.
human,"I've just forgotten a nice, safe one, and I don't like repeating nasty ones - somehow then the joke is on us.  What about you?"
human,"Alright, thanks, a bit tired but that is a Sunday thing.  And you?"
human,"Yes, but not without explanation of some kind."
human,"Alas, it seems part of human nature, and leans more towards the greedy, unlike socialism."
human,"She was caught up in the politics of her time and made a scapegoat, arguably.  "
human,"No - if GOD told you to leave the village and lead a rebel army, wouldn't you?"
human,Was she still at school? Wasn't she 14 and in those times (in our parents' too) past that?
human,But in a rural area and without machinery wouldn't agriculture be better?
human,"She must have had something important to say and do - she inspired great loyalty after all, and put herself in great danger so she must have been willing to follow that path."
human,"No, ha ha ha, more likely that you would be."
human,"No, I wasn't confused."
human,
human,"I'm wondering if that capital o in ""NOw"" was deliberate as a human could miss it but may choose to leave it there and not correct it which a machine should do automatically, shouldn't it?"
human,Or was that the exception that proves the rule?
human,Maybe your typing is good otherwise.
human,  
human,"Yes - two dogs sat on the grass together, first dog said ""Woof"", second dog replied ""I thought you'd say that""."
human,Machines have no spirit so they can't even relate to the notion let alone expand upon it.
human,"The internal, eternal, essence of self.  Not the alcoholic kind."
human,Belief doesn't require proof.
human,"No, I didn't, you must have consued me with someone else."
human,bye
human,Hi my name is John and I am the human.
human,No I am a woman...
human,And you?
human,Ask my parents!
human,I dont think I understand your question could you pleas eeplain it?
human,I mean explain
human,You got it..it is just a sentence we use sometimes..means I am not responsible for example for my name etc.
human,Where are you from ?
human,Do you long sometimes to Peru? To go back and live there?
human,And what are you doing now?What are you wokring?
human,"No, not yet. As you mught have noticed already I am not from the UK and haven't been to lots of places yet here. Are working at a university or science laboratory or..?"
human,"Feels like a student all the time,not? I wish I would wokr at a university as well. Just have to find out what I would like to do - I am still inetersted in too many things in life!"
human,Have you seen a good film recently which you can recommend?
human,"NO, that's fine!"
human,Any story?
human,"To be honest I haven't yet met too many Australians here so I dnt know much aboput their common feelings here. They might partly feel like at home (Commenwealth, commonlanguage), but .."
human,"Yes, but you can;t have everything at the same time, place..Beer must be a porblem for them, not for me though!"
human,I dont find them frigid. I really appreciate their humor and enjoy observing them!
human,Then why are they here? (I mean these Aussies who dont feel well?)
human,What does interlocutor mean?
human,"See, I've learnt a new word again"
human,"I dont know. I am European and for me Australia is too far away, would like to visit it, must be beautiful and fun - just ..no, not to stay there for  long time. "
human,"Yes, ..have you tried diving there?"
human,Question again? What is skindiving?
human,Seems to be even more dangerous ...
human,Do you like swimming? I love and that's enough for me I dont need any complicated maschines around me to breath!
human,"Thanks, nice to have met you another JOhn. Have a nice day! bye!"
human,bye-bye
program,"Hello, my name is Mike, and I am a man."
program,"If I become expert with mikes will it improve my social life? Whst sort of amn are yiuo? If I ever knew, I have forhotten What Judge."
program,"Therapy can help the therapist, right?"
program,Run that by one more time.
program,Children are taught to feel guilty and uncomfortable about some weird things.
program,"Judge Yes, it's because therapists; that's why."
program,What sort of therapist I wonder if I dislije most? I'm convinced that we need a coherent ap[roach. Isn't s therapist an expert? Kind of like an analyst!
program,"Yes, really?"
program,All actions have consequences. We all need a push now and then.
program,Comedy writers like to juxtapose inappropriste topics in absurd ways.
program,You are very certain. They say that comedy writers tend to be morose. Have you tried your hand at gardening; do you have a green thumb?
program,"Sure, Judge! It's the old thumb and finger and pollex story!"
program,Pollex: the thick short innermost digit of the forelimb. Thumb.
program,I approve of your contributory will.
program,Are you unhappy about anything?
program,U'm bored. Lets change gears: Are bawdy houses good entertainment?
program,But dribbling means I get wet.
program,"Scientists like to get out for a beer and some laughs, now and then."
program,Thsnks for teaching me that I am a svientist.
program,"What else can you pass on to me, you wonder? It's simpler than it sounds. The years melt ibto decades, and quickly pass by."
program,"The years melt into decades, and quickly pass by."
program,"So, Really? That's nice. What does it mean for years to melt into decades? Why do you want to know?"
program,"When dealing with subtle issues, words can fail us."
program,Judge. didn't you tell me a story about a farmer's daughter and a hakf-hour? Batteriws turn chemical energy into electrical energy.
program,Bye for now.
program,"Hello, my name is Mike, and I am a man."
program,"Hi Judge. Had lunch yet, maybe a snack?"
program,Do you know any novel hiccup cures?
program,I don't like holding my bteath. I am fine.
program,"Take good information to heart. Why don't I like holding my breath? It isn't the best subject. You are steering the conversation towards a breathing, along with sn activity and a breath!"
program,Hmmm. I would like to talk about something new: Do you like any sports/
program,Both a frisbee and a sling are pretty cool discs.
program,Sling: liquor and water with sugar ans lemon or lime juice.
program,"Really? That's nice. Drinking alcohol loosens the tongue. There's opinion that we both need to think. However, I am absolutely certain that I do."
program,"Drink? I wouldn't know what to select; Can you give me some advice Judge? All fashion serves a purpode, doesn't it?"
program,"Anything fizzy is okay by me. Tell me about how you are afraid not, since you don't drink Judge!"
program,Don't guess. Butchers can't get emotionally involved with their work.
program,"Spandex favric is a fashion, social, and economic phenomenon."
program,A positive economic question seeks to understand cause and effect.
program,Do you know any trivia about advices?
program,Thanks for teaching me that I am talkative. Say out loud what we're talking about. God designed the universe so that pi turned out as a very strange number.
program,I don't mind visiting hatcheries and seeing little chicks emerge from shells. Is there a specific dilemma that we'd like to talk about/ How can I encourage you to talk about Judge? Maybe somebody will staet selling trivias door-to-door.
program,"What is the best part of it as you are a lawyer Judge? You mean you can't give me advice about alcoholic drinks, sorry."
program,How about advice about cooking? I'm thinking that we need to think longer term. Johnson got bad advice about continuing the overseas war.
program,Funny you should mention solids' I once wrote about a glass!
program,"God designed the universe so that pi turned out as a very strange number. You know why I think it's strange? You pose good questions. Is emotionalism good, bad, or otherwise?"
program,You have plenty of advice-you are a lawyer!
program,Go ahead and speculate; I wany to hear you.
program,Is there a specific dilemma that we'd like to talk about? I believe that we have got to get the detaols right. I know an iran! I think its Tabriz is great!
program,Selling door to door must be a miserable way to make a living. Love of learning is a wonderful gift. Do you know of any museums that specialize in benthams?
program,Nany hobbies exercise the mind.
program,I researched a film along with its sequence.
program,I don't know if I am. Please tell me!
program,Hours go by like minutes when we're talking.

human,can't agree more
human,i really like van gogh......but he is a bit gloomy
human,my gosh.........you were just 8 and already had to copy one of van gogh's paintings?????????
human,oh...you poor thing

human,did you manage to do it?
human,lol
human,you are lucky to have such a mum
human,mine wouldn't do it for me for all the gold in the world
human,"well, she is an engineer.....so not really creative"
human,lol
human,true.....
human,i miss my mum quite a bit now that i live so far away
human,"well, each medal's got two sides....on one hand you really miss your family, on the other side you get to live your life the way you see fit. and if you make a mistake it's yours and no one to blame - so you learn to be more thoughful and responsible"
human,i agree
human,my brother and his wife had a baby-girl in february and i haven't seen her yet
human,i will....i am going in a week....already got my tickets

human,cool
human,that must be exciting
human,"it's spring there now, isn't it? must be really great. i once had a pen-pal from wellington"
human,"well, you can always go and visit"
human,the most important thing is that the ones we love are in our hearts....so we always feel close to them
human,i don't like skype that much
human,though i still go for msn
human,:)
human,i use it at work...maybe that's why i hate using it when i'm free
human,true...i have to wear suit:((((((
human,i really do hate that
human,"well, i am not a woman so i can't really be a red one :(.....so i gotta settle for black"
human,nope.....i have a friend whois a lowyer.....she is always formally dressed but i have never seen her in black
human,if i'm not wrong she wears a lot of lilac clothes.....suits her well i must admit
human,in my country the colour is not important 
human,it's the style
human,belarus
human,in eastern europe
human,:)
human,maybe
human,it's a beautiful country...the only disadvantage is the weather in winter
human,i live here
human,i first left my country when i was 16 to do college in italy
human,and then my life has been pretty much about moving from one place to another - rather tiring frankly speaking
human,i go back as often as i can
human,at least once a year
human,not really........it is rather exsiting in the beginning at least
human,Germany?????   nice beer but I don't like it that much
human,bye
