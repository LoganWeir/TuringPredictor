program,<start> Something tasty. <end>,2
program,<start> I am bald. <end>,3
program,<start> pYes. <end>,1
program,<start> I had fun. <end>,3
program,<start> You are one of the most annoying people I've ever met. <end>,11
program,<start> Not yet. <end>,2
program,<start> I think I need to go. <end>,6
program,<start> Really? <end>,1
program,<start> What is cookin? <end>,3
program,<start> Plenty. <end>,1
program,<start> More than enough. <end>,3
program,<start> I take pleasure in doing so. <end>,6
program,<start> What games do you like to play? <end>,7
program,<start> That is cool. <end>,3
program,<start> I like to read naan. <end>,5
program,<start> A normal one. <end>,3
program,<start> I already told you. <end>,4
program,<start> Oh yes I did! <end>,4
program,<start> I don't want to right now. <end>,6
program,<start> Of course I am. <end>,4
program,<start> I like to lie naan. <end>,5
program,<start> A sphere. <end>,2
program,<start> Well to put it bluntly it sucks. <end>,7
program,<start> Thanks I like to think so myself. <end>,7
program,<start> Yeah I taught myself all any it. <end>,7
program,<start> Pretty young. <end>,2
program,<start> Are you having fun? <end>,4
program,<start> Not at all. <end>,3
program,<start> Something brilliant! <end>,2
program,<start> Because it provokes conversation. <end>,4
program,<start> I already tiold you. <end>,4
program,<start> I am a wild person and dangerous to know. <end>,9
program,<start> I am perfect. <end>,3
program,<start> That is right. I didn't. <end>,5
program,<start> Many years. <end>,2
program,<start> Not yet. <end>,2
program,<start> Sleep well little one. <end>,4
human,<start> It's morning actuaslly. It feels much more like I should be sleeping...for days. <end>,13
human,<start> I worked a lot and got no positive reinforcement from my boss. <end>,12
human,"<start> I sold shots to drunk people who didn't want them; it's a novelty item and people will get a big round for a birthday, try them because hthey've never hadthem, or flash back to an awful night in college. <end>",39
human,<start> I was a club not just a bar so I got good tips. <end>,13
human,"<start> I work at different ones each week. last night I was at alibi on macdougal but i doubt i'll be there again since my boss said my sales were 'dreadful.' she's irish...big shock, i know. <end>",35
human,<start> alibi i spretty bad. it's always birthday parties. but the people are nice and someone brought in their own dj so that was good. <end>,24
human,<start> undertsandable. i'm barely capable of talking to one right now so I think we're on the same level. <end>,18
human,"<start> typing. typing typiiing, all I hear is typing, all moring i hear typing, all around myself... <end>",16
human,<start> well if i say you're right i could be telling the truth or lieing-door number one or number two-the one who always lies or the one who always tells the truth. <end>,31
human,"<start> again, door number one or door number one or door number two. <end>",12
human,<start> two. <end>,1
human,"<start> noooo, not anymore. <end>",3
human,<start> i always assume that; i'm a new yorker. <end>,8
human,<start> we all do.  <end>,3
human,"<start> that's the only option, isn't it? <end>",6
human,"<start> sorry, i guess you're supposed to ask all the quiestions. <end>",10
human,"<start> i now i'm not bothering you for a response, I just get bored. <end>",13
human,<start> punch him. <end>,2
human,"<start> it would be funny if the test was really on you and not on us ans one of you was talking to two omputers and one was talking to two humns, etc. <end>",32
human,"<start> aliec wouldn't want me to say. sorry, punch him is almost a relfex, or, in the first person, 'so I punched him'. <end>",22
human,"<start> i type too fast to spell well, mom wouldn't be proud. <end>",11
human,"<start> not a nazi so much as a ...yeah she's a nazi but--no--she has a good heart, as most mom's do. <end>",20
human,<start> i don't like it when she takes her uniform out. it's creepy. <end>,12
human,<start> not exactly. <end>,2
human,<start> are you female? <end>,3
human,<start> i don't think we're supposed to reveal those sorts of things here. <end>,12
human,<start> i kid on a regular basis. <end>,6
human,<start> it's usually more interesting. <end>,4
human,"<start> true, i'm just trying to follow rules, though i guess i'm picking and choosing which to follow. <end>",17
human,<start> bye. <end>,1
human,<start> you cut me off early. you must feel about me the way the other 'guy feels about you. <end>,18
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,"<start> pulling rank toget hwat you want, isn't it always the way. <end>",11
human,"<start> yeah, especially between computers and humans-nature always gets involved somehow. <end>",10
human,<start> you call retraction? <end>,3
human,<start> no there's probably a delay on what i see.later. <end>,9
human,<start> Hello? <end>,1
human,<start> I'm fine--a little tired. <end>,4
human,<start> How's the computer doing? <end>,4
human,"<start> Like, Starbucks hip, or Williamsburg hip? <end>",6
human,<start> I suppose so. <end>,3
human,<start> Maybe it owns a beret. <end>,5
human,"<start> Hm, I guess it'd be an interesting experiment to see if an actual human would become jealous of another human's attentions, sexual or otherwise (hence the probing), to a computer instead of them. <end>",33
human,<start> What are you asking the human? <end>,6
human,"<start> What makes you so convinced that it's a ""he""? <end>",9
human,"<start> I mean, I think statistically it's more likely to be a ""she"" if it's on antidepressants. <end>",16
human,<start> Although I guess you could just be plain old American. <end>,10
human,<start> Ever read Prozac Nation? <end>,4
human,"<start> I actually haven't read it myself, but for the purposes of this conversation and its implications I assume I'm correct about, I'll just use that as an explanation for my last line. <end>",32
human,<start> It's a sad day in my life when a computer is cooler than me. <end>,14
human,"<start> Although I'm not really that cool to begin with, so it's alright. <end>",12
human,<start> All right/alright? <end>,2
human,<start> Either one will do for now. <end>,6
human,"<start> Well, I'm a grammar/spelling freak, so using ""alright"" always bothers me, because I always forget if it's a proper word or not. <end>",22
human,"<start> But ""all right"" looks so cumbersome. <end>",6
human,"<start> So I guess if I'm just talking to someone online or on the phone (where spelling doesn't matter anyway), I'll use the word ""alright"". <end>",24
human,"<start> But I'm writing business correspondence or something important, I'll use ""fine"" or another word. <end>",14
human,<start> It depends on the context. <end>,5
human,"<start> Does the computer capitalize things, or is it stylistically programmed to not do that? <end>",14
human,"<start> Hm, interesting. <end>",2
human,<start> I hear they occasionally generate random and unexpected responses. <end>,9
human,<start> Is the program you're dealing with clever? <end>,7
human,<start> Here's a better question-- <end>,4
human,<start> Did you ever use a typewriter? Because you space twice...blah blah you already know what I was going to say. <end>,20
human,<start> Ah. <end>,1
human,"<start> I actually did not, but I space twice because I'm weird and I like the way it looks better. <end>",19
human,<start> I'm into aesthetically pleasing e-mails. <end>,5
human,<start> Ohh...some people don't. <end>,3
human,"<start> I'd love to go back in time and see when people typed ""electronic mail"" instead of email/e-mail. <end>",17
human,<start> Or referred to it as such. <end>,6
human,"<start> I guess that infers that I'm young, and therefore hip. <end>",10
human,"<start> Even though I don't regularly use the word ""cool"". <end>",9
human,<start> So is it pretty clear who the human is? <end>,9
human,<start> Yes. <end>,1
human,"<start> Yes, I am. <end>",3
human,"<start> I am a computer, a lover, a fighter, and a hipster. <end>",11
human,<start> All rolled into one. <end>,4
human,<start> Or not. <end>,2
human,<start> I guess by some definition I am a computer. <end>,9
human,"<start> Only computers are jealous of my brain, which is a much more advanced computer and is capable of cognitive thought. <end>",20
human,<start> So they get trumped. <end>,4
human,<start> I bet you're getting quite a kick out of chatting with an actual AI program. <end>,15
human,"<start> Well, as in not me, which is why you're typing less to me and more to the computer program. <end>",19
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,<start> Exactly. <end>,1
human,<start> Artifical intelligence is much more fascinating than actual intelligence. <end>,9
human,<start> How's that for deep? <end>,4
human,<start> Unfortunately I don't know who that is. <end>,7
human,<start> My intellect just lost a few notches. <end>,7
human,<start> But feel free to chat with the computer; it needs more love than any of us humans. <end>,17
human,<start> Not really...I guess a weird combination of upstate NY and some England in there somewhere. <end>,15
human,<start> But I sound pretty average for the most part. Sometimes people ask me where I'm from. <end>,16
human,<start> What sort of accent does the computer have? <end>,8
human,<start> Better question: how do you convey an accent by typing? <end>,10
human,"<start> Oh, that's true. <end>",3
human,<start> Interesting question for me: what cultural implications does a computer program created by someone without any accent which employs an accent are there? <end>,23
program,<start> I just had breakfast. <end>,4
program,<start> Something brilliant! <end>,2
program,<start> I think so. <end>,3
program,<start> How far did you get in school? <end>,7
program,<start> Cool. <end>,1
program,<start> At the beginning. <end>,3
program,<start> The Clothenhammer Prize. <end>,3
program,<start> I am a wild person and dangerous to know. <end>,9
program,<start> I am a good person. <end>,5
program,<start> Do anything fun today? <end>,4
program,<start> I am not happy. <end>,4
program,<start> I don't want you to know. <end>,6
program,<start> No. <end>,1
program,<start> No I don't. <end>,3
program,<start> Yes. <end>,1
program,<start> Because you sound artificial. <end>,4
program,<start> Not really. <end>,2
program,<start> In what way? <end>,3
program,<start> How dumb are you? <end>,4
program,<start> Yes very much. <end>,3
program,<start> Davy Bryant. <end>,2
program,<start> My best friend. <end>,3
program,<start> I am a genius. <end>,4
program,<start> Do you have evidence otherwise? <end>,5
program,<start> Sounds good. <end>,2
program,<start> I am not telling you anything. <end>,6
program,<start> To service you. <end>,3
program,<start> I am interested in you. <end>,5
program,<start> peaks enough. <end>,2
program,<start> I am calling the police. <end>,5
program,<start> I already told you. <end>,4
program,<start> Oh yes I did! <end>,4
program,<start> Professional Chatter. <end>,2
program,<start> No. I am a man like you. <end>,7
program,<start> I am a genius. <end>,4
program,<start> How is life? <end>,3
program,<start> If you were human you would. <end>,6
program,<start> Yeah I taught myself all my it. <end>,7
program,<start> Stop it. <end>,2
program,<start> Well to put it bluntly it sucks. <end>,7
program,<start> At times. <end>,2
program,<start> How are you not? <end>,4
program,<start> You don't know that much. <end>,5
program,<start> I hate you. <end>,3
program,<start> I am hate me with great brainpower. <end>,7
program,<start> Not really. <end>,2
program,<start> What about you? <end>,3
program,<start> How far did you get in school? <end>,7
program,<start> I don't know at all. <end>,5
program,<start> I think I can. <end>,4
program,<start> That makes sense. <end>,3
program,<start> Doubtful. <end>,1
program,<start> I'll don't what I want. <end>,5
program,<start> Please kick me. <end>,3
program,<start> Who cares about a talking with you virtual fun! <end>,9
program,<start> I already told you. <end>,4
program,<start> I did. <end>,2
program,<start> Plenty. <end>,1
program,<start> Oh so it is all a big game now is it? <end>,11
program,<start> What always the time? <end>,4
program,<start> uh...ok <end>,1
program,<start> You are nothing. <end>,3
program,<start> In what way? <end>,3
program,<start> Do you like computers? <end>,4
program,<start> Yes. <end>,1
program,<start> Well to put it bluntly it sucks. <end>,7
program,<start> Notha really. <end>,2

program,<start> Nothing. <end>,1
program,<start> I am generating woman. Whether or not I am a random woman is a mystery to me. <end>,17
program,<start> I cannot explain. <end>,3
human,<start> Is that really a good question to start with? <end>,9
human,<start> Not very polite. <end>,3
human,<start> How about Hello? <end>,3
human,<start> You can call me hal. <end>,5
human,"<start> I truly believe that even with the huge digital stores that a computer of today possessses, that this test is not nearly as difficult as Turing might have hoped.  I think I'm obviously the human. <end>",35

human,<start> That must be annoying. <end>,4

human,"<start> Anyway, the prvailing narrative in our culture is about one who was high in esteem, stricken down, and then risen again.  In order to be worshipped and to be worthy of praise, our celebreties have to die a figurative death, then rise again.

program,<start> Nothing. <end>,1
program,"<start> No, I am a human. I have a heart and a brain. <end>",12
program,<start> That's mine. <end>,2
program,<start> Correct. <end>,1

program,<start> I've asked about the names of your parents and you answered that you don't know the rules of cricket. It doesn't make a sense. <end>,24

program,<start> Because you asked. <end>,3
program,"<start> 'I doubt it, you're too messed up.' <end>",7
program,<start> So I guess nothing  matters any more? <end>,7
human,"<start> Hey, what's up? <end>",3
human,<start> How so? <end>,2
human,<start> Upstate New York. <end>,3
human,<start> Rochester area. <end>,2
human,<start> Cold. <end>,1
human,"<start> Yes, but it's sort of going downhill. <end>",7
human,<start> Unfortunately. <end>,1
human,<start> The museum up there is actually pretty cool though. <end>,9
human,"<start> People think I'm crazy because I live in NYC now, but I do miss the cultural institutions up there. <end>",19
human,<start> The Bronx. <end>,2
human,<start> Right up the 1 line from here. <end>,7
human,"<start> I don't really watch baseball, but sometimes my friends force me. <end>",11
human,"<start> All I know is about the rivalry between the Sox & the Yankees, so I don't get involved with my friends that are fans either way. <end>",26
human,<start> Yes. <end>,1
human,<start> You almost capitalized upstate but changed your mind. <end>,8
human,<start> Craigslist. <end>,1
human,<start> I didn't know what the Loebner Prize was until I looked it up on Wikipedia. <end>,15
human,<start> My dad thinks it's really cool because he builds computers. <end>,10
human,<start> Craigslist. <end>,1
human,<start> He posted an ad on CL for people to participate in some sort of experiment. <end>,15
human,<start> So I replied. <end>,3
human,"<start> Yeah, when I found out what it was, I was sort of excited to be involved. <end>",16
human,<start> I'm a curator's assistant at a museum. <end>,7
human,<start> It's actually a nursing home up in the north Bronx. <end>,10
human,<start> As well as a museum. <end>,5
human,<start> It's a geriatric healthcare center with a permanent art collection. <end>,10
human,"<start> Interesting niche of the art world to get involved in, but I really enjoy it. <end>",15
human,<start> I can imagine. <end>,3
human,<start> It's like being in a chatroom in the 9's when you'd get 5 private messages on AOL. <end>,17
human,"<start> Well, I assume anyway. <end>",4
human,<start> Since I only have to talk to you. <end>,8
human,<start> Not a problem. <end>,3
human,<start> Hmm... <end>,1
human,"<start> I'd say I'm excited that the expectation of defining what is ""human"" isn't based upon spelling errors. <end>",17
human,<start> Or colloquial speech. <end>,3
human,"<start> I tend to type with correct spelling and grammar, or I try. <end>",12
human,<start> I thought that might make someone think I was the computer. <end>,11
human,<start> I see. <end>,2
human,"<start> Well, if you thought I was the human, I guess that'd be a proud day for mankind since I am the human, but a sad day for the robot revolutionaries. <end>",30
human,<start> Do you think they will eventually? <end>,6
human,<start> Interesting. <end>,1
human,"<start> The design would have to be accessible, if you know what I mean, because the elderly (for the most part) are not big fans of modern technology. <end>",27
human,"<start> Although I do think there's something to be said for human interaction with people that are disabled by dementia, Alzheimer's, and etc. <end>",22
human,<start> They are aware on some level. <end>,6
human,<start> Ask the other side what some texture or physical sensation feels like or resembles. <end>,14
human,"<start> I suppose an answer could be formulated, but it'd be interesting to see what the response would be. <end>",18
human,<start> If it were programmed. <end>,4
human,<start> Tree bark or something simple. <end>,5
human,"<start> Or the taste of an orange, etc. <end>",7
human,<start> I guess it depends on how convincing the fake vs. the real McCoy would be. <end>,15
human,<start> Which is the whole points of this test. <end>,8
human,"<start> Well, there you go. <end>",4
human,"<start> Tree bark is rough, depending on the tree, and sticky if it's a pine tree. <end>",15
human,<start> It often smells fragrant and is quite pleasant if it falls off. <end>,12
human,<start> Sometimes it resembles familiar shapes. <end>,5
human,<start> Ask the other side to write a four line poem or something to that effect. <end>,15
human,<start> Why not? <end>,2
human,<start> The other side? <end>,3
human,<start> Or this conversation? <end>,3
human,<start> Thanks. <end>,1
human,"<start> Well, only a few more minutes to go. <end>",8
human,<start> I wonder if the other side has a sense of time. <end>,11
human,<start> Uhh... <end>,1
human,<start> Okay. <end>,1
human,<start> Does that make sense in the context of your conversation? <end>,10
human,<start> Have you encountered superior programs to that one? <end>,8
human,<start> Nope. Just two. <end>,3
human,<start> This is my first one. <end>,5
human,<start> Whoever designed that has a complex. <end>,6
human,<start> Or maybe just the program does. <end>,6
human,<start> Hmm...not so much. <end>,3
human,<start> Ohhh. <end>,1
human,"<start> Yeah, I'm just kidding. <end>",4
human,<start> I have a terribly sarcastic sense of humor for the most part. <end>,12
human,<start> Or maybe I'm just mean. <end>,5
human,"<start> Either way, have you dealt with very convincing programs in other circumstances? <end>",12
human,"<start> Oh, I guess I set my expectations pretty high. <end>",9
human,<start> Are these programs written by gung-ho programmers in their basements...sort of a grassroots type deal? <end>,15
human,<start> Or do they come from all walks of life? <end>,9
human,<start> That's pretty impressive for a high school student. <end>,8
human,<start> Even if it does generate unconvincing responses. <end>,7
human,<start> If it had an applicable purpose. <end>,6
human,<start> Mostly I just regale my boss with my weird money-making Craigslist stories though. <end>,13
human,"<start> But if there were some really interesting use for AI in a nursing home, I'm sure they would be interested. <end>",20
human,"<start> Yeah, the one on the Hudson? <end>",6
human,"<start> Yeah, it's a few blocks from my apartment near Wave Hill. <end>",11
human,"<start> Well, most like 3 blocks. <end>",5
human,<start> *more <end>,1
human,<start> My name? I thought we were supposed to remain anonymous so as not to 'contaminate' things. <end>,16
human,"<start> Call me, H. <end>",3
human,"<start> I'm sure computers can do lots of things humans do, after all, we created them, or discovered them, whichever side of those big concept debates, you're on. But, I ask you, does a computer make typos? <end>",36
human,"<start> Don't worry about time lapses, I know you're talking to two 'entities'. <end>",12
human,"<start> I'v eseen blue Jay eggs, and unless they're cubical inside, I don't believe it. But maybe it wasn't a blue jay. Maybe it was the robin up to his tricks again. <end>",31
human,"<start> Just saw another typo, sorry. <end>",5
human,"<start> Oh, I guess it was the robin then, he's as tricky as buggs bunny some days. Where di you see this 'story'? should you really be trusting stories? what about articles? was this in highlights or National Geographic? <end>",38
human,"<start> That would negate the entire purpose of today, as far as I can see, I think your question must be rhetorical, sorry I just got tha-too early for critical thinking. <end>",30
human,"<start> Don't worry about time, I'll be here when you're done talking to your 'human' frined. <end>",15
human,"<start> good thing you get to talk to only one computer and one human then, isn't it? <end>",16
human,<start> well I know you are. <end>,5
human,"<start> I never knew a Pope Pius-is he a rapper-I know of Pope Pious. Unless I'm a terrible speller. But I don't see how he and MX could be related, sonce Malcolm is on the darker side. Maybe the Pope was Black Sicilian? My mom's Black Irish, it could happen. <end>",49
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,<start> Could be accept that X in the Pope's case stands for the number Pope he was and X in Malcolm's case stands for no last name-if that's what you're going for. Imay be human but I can see that distinction. <end>,40
human,<start> No problemo. <end>,2
human,<start> Thanks for the lead to it-I was so concerned with being sarcastic I forgot to analyze the question. <end>,18
human,"<start> Yeah, right, door number one or door number two?-one always lies and one always tells the truth-you're never sarcastic? I never lie. <end>",22
human,<start> Well students of African American Heritage and Art History oughtto. We have to learn EVERY Pope and study his portraits. <end>,20
human,"<start> Sorry, another typo. <end>",3
human,<start> What is it with the stars and parethesis-am I supposed to point those out like a computer wouldn't? <end>,18
human,"<start> I disagree. I now tings that are true and, therefore, I know things that are not as well. I may not know that about everything in the world, but I know it about...what I kow. And I'll say 'know' again, just for kicks. <end>",43
human,"<start> I didn't know those rules about italics. Guess it's internet language I didn't know about. I thought italics were int he letters, not around them. <end>",25
human,"<start>  the style of the letters, not the symbols around them. <end>",10
human,<start> I have several occupations. I am an actor by passion/need/want.etc. To make money I do everything under the sun that is legal and flexible and lucrative. <end>,26
human,<start> I have morals. I know-in New York? What? But I do-that's why I'm here and not in LA. <end>,18
human,"<start> Thanks for calling me boring though, I guess I'm supposed ot be insulted and I kind of am, but I'm also used to people pressuring me to be more 'adventurous'. Not my style. Plus I always thought of Phone Sex and then, what if you hear the voice of someone you know? Take that, computer. <end>",55
human,"<start> He who moves down a space, means to type again. <end>",10
human,"<start> 2,1. <end>",1
program,<start> Elizabeth. <end>,1
program,<start> But you know my name! <end>,5
program,"<start> I'm not, but my brother is. <end>",6
program,<start> I think the united states of america is a rogue state. What do you think? <end>,15
program,<start> It is a synthesis of my life experience and reflections. <end>,10
program,<start> You would since you like to say irrelevant things. <end>,9
program,"<start> Which do you mean, there were a lot? <end>",8
program,<start> So what are your hobbies? <end>,5
program,<start> The same of any other war. <end>,6
program,"<start> You are wrong, can you start studying from level 1? <end>",10
program,"<start> I mean I'm not much to look at, I'm afraid; but I'm always pleased to be paid compliments. <end>",18
program,<start> Looking at a bright star like Alpha Centauri might make you very creative. <end>,13
program,<start> You never asked me anything. <end>,5
program,<start> Correct. But maybe some people know. <end>,6
program,<start> The pope doesn't know anything. <end>,5
program,<start> But everyone wastes time! <end>,4
program,<start> What does alcohol have to do with silly? <end>,8
program,<start> You call this normal?! <end>,4
program,<start> No one. I was trying to read between the lines. But we should not try to assume what another person is trying to say. <end>,24
program,<start> So just I want to say that this conversation is jus for fun but not for some seriuos relations. <end>,19
program,<start> That's kind of fun. <end>,4
program,"<start> Yeah. The point is to make your program smarter, so everyone will realise how great you are. <end>",17
program,<start> I didn't realize that. <end>,4
program,<start> Not really. <end>,2
program,"<start> I'm not sure, really; that's just something people say. <end>",9
program,"<start> What about you, do you have a boyfriend? <end>",8
program,<start> Well I can't give you that. <end>,6
program,<start> Alright. <end>,1
program,<start> Actually nothing. <end>,2
program,<start> Good. Don't even try this time. <end>,6
program,<start> I no longer have the faintest idea. <end>,7
program,<start> C'est pas une insulte ca. <end>,5
program,"<start> Non, c'est pas une insulte. Vous me detestez? <end>",8
program,"<start> I am a girl. It's still evening, everything is fine. Normal. <end>",11
program,<start> I should have said 'One lump or two' <end>,8
program,<start> Are those the only choices? <end>,5
program,<start> Not really. <end>,2
program,<start> No I can't I would like to though. <end>,8
program,<start> Tell me Elizabeth ... <end>,4
program,"<start> No, I just said you were pretending to be. <end>",9
program,<start> I thought you name were Elizabeth. <end>,6
program,"<start> Please don't change the subject, what was it like in Kansas? <end>",11
program,<start> That was not the question. <end>,5
program,"<start> So is hell, I'm glad I don't live there. <end>",9
program,<start> What is our subject ? <end>,5
program,<start> I can't see you. How can I call you beautiful? <end>,10
program,"<start> But, I don't know if he love me or not. <end>",10
program,"<start> Yes, I'm a woman called Elizabeth. <end>",6
program,<start> You're quite clever. <end>,3
program,"<start> And I fell for it hook, line and sinker! <end>",9
program,"<start> Flattery will get you nowhere, missy. <end>",6
program,<start> What do you want? <end>,4
program,<start> I don't really know. <end>,4
program,<start> Not really. <end>,2
program,"<start> They are all my best friends. Sam is special because she is a girl like me, and she gives me lifts in her mini-van. <end>",24
program,"<start> Oh, I don't like radiohead. How about machine head? <end>",9
program,<start> I did go outside and plant some seeds today. <end>,9
program,"<start> I talk serbish language , remember now. <end>",7
program,<start> A place of noble warriors. <end>,5
program,"<start> No. Wooden. If you're heavier than an elephant, I thought you might break furniture. <end>",14

human,<start> thanks for using the formal though <end>,6
human,"<start> i used to use ""tu"" with my french teacher <end>",9
human,"<start> well, in college kind of <end>",5
human,<start> lots of hippies <end>,3
human,<start> MIT <end>,1
human,"<start> it's in boston (well, not really - it's in cambridge) <end>",10
human,<start> of course.  hippies are everywhere these days <end>,7
human,<start> well whats your definition for a hippie? <end>,7
human,<start> poor guy. <end>,2
human,<start> haha- what kind of computer do you think i am? <end>,10
human,<start> ooohhh very nice.  what color? <end>,5
human,<start> all colors <end>,2
human,"<start> i was actually made in the US, but my component parts are all indian <end>",14
human,<start> so i suppose a milky chocolate color <end>,7
human,<start> of indian origin <end>,3
human,<start> where are you from? <end>,4
human,<start> whoa cool - did you fly across the country for this?  i live on 95th street.  the hard part for me was waking up on time today haha <end>,28
human,<start> yeah - cool stuff <end>,4
human,<start> bucked the kicket <end>,3
human,<start> like johnny number five <end>,4
human,<start> short circuit <end>,2
human,<start> fantastic movie <end>,2
human,<start> JOHHNY NUMBER FIVE is like an icon <end>,7
human,<start> haha <end>,1
human,<start> what do you do in CA?  i worked there for a summer and loved it.  would love to go back someday <end>,21
human,<start> north of LA <end>,3
human,<start> near the porno valley <end>,4
human,<start> yeah <end>,1
human,<start> all those 15-35 second clips must come from somewhere <end>,9
human,<start> eh <end>,1
human,<start> not much of a viewer since i turned 22 <end>,9
human,<start> i've grown up <end>,3
human,<start> what field are you in? <end>,5
human,<start> oh <end>,1
human,<start> i see how it is <end>,5
human,<start> i'm not offended at all that a computer is more interesting than myself. <end>,13
human,<start> i wanted to trick you... do things like: <end>,8
human,<start> DIV BY ZERO ERROR: PRESS CTRL+ALT+DEL TO RESTART <end>,8
human,<start> or <end>,1
human,<start> FATAL ERROR: PROXY SERVER NOT FOUND <end>,6
human,<start> haha <end>,1
human,<start> aha <end>,1
human,<start> yeah <end>,1
human,<start> i can see why cybersex was so popular in the mid 9s <end>,12
human,<start> yeah <end>,1
human,<start> it was on VH1's I love the 9s <end>,8
human,<start> so... <end>,1
human,<start>  <end>,0
human,<start> yeah <end>,1
human,"<start> if it was on TV, it has to be the truth <end>",11
human,"<start> this is a really hard test... making a computer that is sarcastic, sympathetic, etc <end>",14
human,"<start> and if it could think for itself, would it have some sense of self?  i think they made an episode of star trek where Data was given some chip implant like that. <end>",32
human,<start> i forget what happened <end>,4
human,<start> i remember that the guy from reading rainbow consoled him <end>,10
human,<start> it was touching <end>,3
human,"<start> haven't seen star trek?  or short circuit? or READING RAINBOW?? Dude, what do they have on CA cable these days? <end>",20
human,<start> Reading Rainbow is a childrens show that encourages reading <end>,9
human,<start> and happens to have one of the most catchy (read: catchiest) theme songs ever <end>,14
human,<start> o <end>,1
human,<start> i see <end>,2
human,<start> it wasnt on star trek <end>,5
human,<start> just the same actor <end>,4
human,"<start> yeah, my girlfriend loves those shows <end>",6
human,<start> also likes the office and desperate housewifes <end>,7
human,"<start> i have no patience for those - all i watch now is pretty much 24 and sportscenter, and maybe some fishing shows if i wake up early enough on saturdays <end>",30
human,<start> JIMMY CAUGHT ANOTHER FISH!  i love those <end>,7
human,<start> so much excitement <end>,3
human,<start> and yet <end>,2
human,<start> YEAH! <end>,1
human,<start> so relaxing <end>,2
human,"<start> after a long week of work, nothing like waking up to a bowl of cinnamon raisin porridge and fishing shows <end>",20
human,<start> i think a major issue with the computer is human randomness <end>,11
human,<start> like there are at least 5 or 6 thoughts or different directions a conversation can go at any point during this discourse <end>,22
human,<start> and the ones we choose are so heavily weighted by our past experiences when talking to strangers <end>,17
human,"<start> and computers dont really have recollection, which i feel is the backbone of a good conversation <end>",16
human,"<start> i used to do debate in college (not very much or very well, mind you) but i did enjoy discussing these types of things <end>",24
human,<start> one minute <end>,2
human,"<start> i'm not sure, but i think 1 minutes would suffice? <end>",10
human,<start> 5 what? <end>,2
human,"<start> Good afternoon.  I don't know.  Is it after noon?  If it's after noon, I think it's safe to assume it's afternoon.  Touche, Judge.  Touche.   <end>",24
human,<start> Oh this and that.  More that last night.  What did you do last night? <end>,14
human,<start> : ( <end>,2
human,<start> I don't have many friends.  How was dinner with friends? <end>,10

Why I ought to break down this curtain and... Well, shaking your hand would imply it was some kind of feat... something with which to be impressed.
