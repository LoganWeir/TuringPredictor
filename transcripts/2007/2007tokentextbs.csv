human,<start> What are you asking the human?
human,"<start> h BackSpace What makes you con BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace so convinced that it's a ""he""> BackSpace ?"
human,"<start> I mean, I  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace , I think statisicall BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace i BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace s BackSpace tatistically it's more likely to be a""s BackSpace  BackSpace  s BackSpace ""she"" if it's on anit BackSpace  BackSpace tideprr BackSpace essants."

human,<start> Ever read Prozac Nation?
human,"<start> I actually haven't read it myself, but for the purposes of this conversation and its implications I assume I'm correct about, I'll just use that as an explanation for my last line."
human,<start> It's a sad day in my life when a computer is cooler than me.
human,"<start> Altough I BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace hough I'm not really that cool to begin with, so t BackSpace it's alright."
human,"<start> All right, o BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace /alright? I BackSpace  BackSpace "
human,<start> Either one will do for now.
human,"<start> Well, I'm a grammar/sep BackSpace  BackSpace pelling freak, so using ""alright"" always bothers me, because I always forget it BackSpace f it's a proper word or not."
human,"<start> But ""all right"" looks so cumbersome."
human,"<start> so I gu BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace So I guess if it BackSpace  BackSpace I'm just talking to sme BackSpace  BackSpace omeone online or on the phone,  BackSpace  BackSpace  (where spelling doesn't matter anyway), I'll use the word ""alright""."
human,"<start> But I'm re BackSpace  BackSpace writing business correspondeonce  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace nce or something important, I'll use ""fine"" or another wro BackSpace  BackSpace ord."
human,<start> It depends ont he cont BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  the context.
human,"<start> Does the computer capli BackSpace  BackSpace italized thi BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  things, or is it BackSpace  BackSpace it stylistically programmed to not do that?"
human,"<start> Hm, interesting."
human,<start> I hear they occasionally generate random and unexpected respones BackSpace  BackSpace ses.
human,<start> Is the program you're dealing with clever/ BackSpace ?
human,<start> Here's a better question--
human,"<start> Did you ever use a typewriter, because you space w BackSpace twice after each st BackSpace = BackSpace entenc BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace ? Because you space twice...blah blah you already know what I was going to say."
human,<start> Ah.
human,"<start> I c BackSpace actually did not, but I space twice because I'm weird and I like the way it looks better."
human,<start> I'm into a BackSpace aesthetically pleasing em BackSpace -mails.
human,<start> Hyp BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace Ohh...w BackSpace co BackSpace  BackSpace some people don't.
human,"<start> I'd love to go back an BackSpace  BackSpace in time and ssee BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace ee when people typed ""electronic mail"" instead of email/e-a BackSpace mail."
human,<start> Or referred to it as such.
human,"<start> I guess that infers that I'm young, and therefore hip."
human,"<start> Even though I do't  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace n't e BackSpace regularly use the word ""col"" BackSpace  BackSpace ol""."
human,<start> So is it prettycl BackSpace  BackSpace  clear who the human is?
human,"<start> Yes, BackSpace ."
human,"<start> Yes, I am."
human,"<start> I am a computer, a lover, a fighter, and a hipster."
human,<start> All roo BackSpace lled int one. BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace o one.
human,<start> Or not.
human,<start> I guess by some definition I am a computer.
human,"<start> Only computers are jealous of my brain, which is a much more advanced computer and ca BackSpace  BackSpace is capable of cognif BackSpace tive thought."
human,<start> So  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace So they get trumped.
human,<start> I bet you're getting quit a BackSpace  BackSpace e a kick out of chatting with an actual AI program.
human,"<start> Well, as in not me, which is why you're typing less to me and more to the computer program."
human,<start> Computer BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace 
human,<start> W BackSpace Exactly.
human,<start> Artifical intelligence is much more fascinating than actual intelligence.
human,<start> How's that for deep?
human,<start> Unfortunately I don't know who that is.
human,<start> My intellect just lost a few notches.
human,<start> But feel free to chat with the computer; it needs more love than any of us humans.

human,<start> What sor to  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace t of accent does the computer have?
human,<start> Better question: how do you convey an accent by typing?
human,"<start> Oh, that's true."
human,<start> Interesting question for me: what cltu BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace ultural implications does a computer program created by someone without any accent which implies an  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace employs an accent hav BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace are there?

human,<start> You almost capitlize BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace italized upstate but changed y BackSpace  BackSpace  your mind.
human,<start> Craigslist.
human,<start> I didn't know what the Loebner PRize BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace rize was until I looked it up on Wikipedia.
human,<start> My dad thinks it's really cool because he builds computers.
human,<start> Craigslist.
human,<start> He  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace He posted an ad on the BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace CL for people to participate in some sort of experiment.
human,<start> So I replied.
human,"<start> I BackSpace Yeah, C BackSpace when I found out what it was, i BackSpace I was sort of excited to eb i BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace be involved."
human,<start> I'm a curator's assistant at a museum.
human,<start> It's actually an BackSpace  nursing home up in the north br BackSpace  BackSpace Bronx.
human,<start> As well as a museum.
human,<start> It's a geriatric helathc BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace althcare enc BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace center with a perment  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace anent art collection.
human,"<start> Interesting niche of the art world to get involved in, but I really enjoy it."
human,<start> I can imagine.
human,<start> It's like being  in BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace in a chatroom in the 9's when you'd get 5p BackSpace  private messages on AOL  BackSpace .
human,"<start> Well, I assume anyway."
human,<start> Since I only have to talk to you.
human,<start> Not a problem.
human,<start> Hmm...
human,"<start> I'd say I'm excited that the expectation of defining what is ""human"" isn't based upon  BackSpace  BackSpace n spelling errors."
human,<start> Or colloquial speech.
human,"<start> I tned BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace end tot yp BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  type with correct spelling and grammar, so BackSpace  BackSpace or I try."
human,<start> I thought that might make someone think I was the computer.
human,<start> I see.
human,"<start> Well, if you thought I was the human, I guess that'd be a proud day for mankind since I amt he h BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  the human, but s BackSpace a sad sd BackSpace  BackSpace day for the robot revolutionaries."
human,<start> Do you think they wei BackSpace  BackSpace ill eventually?
human,<start> INte BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace nteresting.
human,"<start> The design would have to be accessible  BackSpace , if you know what I mean, because the elderly (for the most part) are not big fans of modern technology."
human,"<start> Although I do think there's something to be said for human interaction with people that are disabled by dementia, Alzheimer's, and etc."

human,"<start> I suppose an answer could be formulated, but it'd be interesting to see what the response would be."
human,<start> If it were programmed.
human,<start> Tree bark or something simple.
human,"<start> Or the taste of an orange, etc."
human,<start> I guess it dpe BackSpace  BackSpace epends on how convincing the fake vs. the real McCoy would be.
human,<start> Which is the whole points of this test.
human,"<start> Well, there you go."
human,"<start> Tree bark is rough, dpe BackSpace  BackSpace epending on the tree, and sticky if it's a pine tree."
human,<start> It often smells fragrant and is quite pleasant if it falls off.
human,<start> Sometimes it resembles anthro BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace famifli BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace liar shapes.
human,<start> Ask the other side to write a four line poem or something to that effect.
human,<start> Why not?
human,<start> The other side?
human,<start> Or this conversation?
human,<start> Thanks.
human,"<start> Well, only a few more minutes to go."
human,<start> I wonder if the other side has a sense of time.
human,<start> Uhh...
human,<start> OKay. BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace kay.
human,<start> Does thatma BackSpace  BackSpace  make sense in the context of your conversation?
human,<start> Have you encountered superior programs to that one?
human,<start> Nope. Just two.
human,<start> This is my first one.
human,<start> Whoever designed that has a complex.
human,<start> Or maybe just the program does.
human,<start> Hmm...not so much.
human,<start> Ohhh.
human,"<start> Yeah, I'm just kidding."
human,<start> I have at e BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  terribly sarcastic sense of humor for the most part.
human,<start> Or maybe Im j BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace 'm just mean.
human,"<start> Either way, have ou en BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace you dealt with very convincing programs in other curc BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace ircumstances?"
human,"<start> Oh, I guess I se  BackSpace t my expecat BackSpace  BackSpace tations pretty high."
human,<start> I BackSpace Are theswe j BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace e BackSpace se programs written by gung-g BackSpace ho programmers in their basements...sort of a grassroots type deal?
human,<start> Or dot BackSpace  they come from all walks of life?
human,<start> O BackSpace That's pretty impressive for a high school student.
human,<start> Even if it does generate unconvincing responses.
human,<start> At t BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace If it had an applicable prupo BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace urpose.
human,<start> Mostly I just regale my boss with my weird money-making Craigslist stories though.
human,"<start> But if there were some really interesting use for AI in th BackSpace  BackSpace a nursing home, I'm sure it would be intereste BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace they would be interested."
human,"<start> Yeah, the one on the Hudson?"
human,"<start> Yeah, it's a few blocks from my hou BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace apartment near Wave Hill."
human,"<start> Well, most like 3 bv BackSpace locks."

human,"<start> I'm sure computers can do lots of things humen BackSpace  BackSpace ans do, after all, we created them, or discovered them, whichever side of those big concept debates, you're on. But, I ask you, does a computer make typos?"

Maybe the Pope was Black Sicilian? My mom's Black Irish, it could happen."
human,<start> Buuut BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace 
human,<start>  BackSpace Could be accept that X in the Pope's case stands for the number Pope he was and X in Malcolm's case is  BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace stands for no last name-if that's what you're going for. Imay be hm BackSpace uman but I can see that distinction.
human,<start> No problemo.
