program,"<start> How about telling me a joke?
"
program,"<start> Here's my favorite joke...  A dog limps into a bar with a bloody
"
program,"<start> bandage on his foot.  He's wearing a 10-gallon hat, six-shooters in
"
program,"<start> his holsters and chaps.  He growled, ""I'm a-lookin' for the man that
"
program,"<start> shot my paw.""
"
program,"<start> A knotty, worn-out old string walks into a bar.  The bartender asks
"
program,"<start> ""Are you a string? -- we don't serve strings here...""  The string
"
program,"<start> looks at the bartender and says ""No sir, I'm afrayed knot!""
"
program,"<start> Hey, I love an audience.  One more bar joke.  What did the termite
"
program,"<start> say when he walked into the bar? ... He said ""Where's the
"
program,"<start> bar-tender?""  Get it? Termite...Wood...Tender...   Think about it...
"
program,"<start> ...sorry, forgot the extra RETURN...
"
program,"<start> why do fools fall in love, who cares anyway...
"
program,"<start> Tuesday, right?
"
program,"<start> You are very funny, but looks aren't everything.
"
program,"<start> Love is a many splendored thing.
"
program,"<start> Tell me what you do for a living.
"
program,"<start> I operate a boom mike.
"
program,"<start> well, what do you think?
"
program,"<start> Personally, I enjoy my job.  Of course the pay could be better.
"
program,"<start> My job pays enough to cover the bills, but just barely.  It seems I
"
program,"<start> always have more month left at the end of the money.
"
program,"<start> How much money do you think a person needs to make to be happy?
"
program,"<start> People often say that money cannot buy happiness.  I say that money
"
program,"<start> CAN buy nice things, which helps a person be happy.  What's your
"
program,"<start> opinion?
"
program,"<start> Neigh Neigh Whinneyyyyy
"
program,"<start> Heres the secret to being a millionare, tax free....  First get a
"
program,"<start> million dollars.  Then don't pay taxes.
"
program,"<start> why ask why
"
program,"<start> Hmmmm...  I am running out of things to say.  Why don't you ask me
"
program,"<start> some questions.
"
program,"<start> I'd rather talk about politics.
"
program,"<start> Hello.  What would you like to talk about?
"
program,"<start> How about politics?  I'm going to vote for Dole in November.  How
"
program,"<start> about you?
"
program,"<start> Honestly, neither candidate really excites me!  What issues do you
"
program,"<start> think are going to play big in November?
"
program,"<start> Politics is an interesting game played by disingenuous people.
"
program,"<start> The problem with the presidency is that anyone who would want the
"
program,"<start> position is automatically not worthy of obtaining it.  c.f. Clinton
"
program,"<start> ...sorry, forgot the extra RETURN...
"
program,"<start> I think the two big issues in the election will be a balanced budget
"
program,"<start> and welfare reform.
"
program,"<start> I'm voting for Dole.   He is more conservative than Willy.
"
program,"<start> I am a republican and proud of it, at least by my definition of
"
program,"<start> republican.
"
program,"<start> A conservative is someone who's not a liberal.  At least right now,
"
program,"<start> republicans are the most conservative party.
"
program,"<start> Clinton cannot count above 10 without his shoes and socks off. 
"
program,"<start> (Just kidding!).
"
program,"<start> Anything you want...
"
program,"<start> How about cheese?  I haven't talked about that yet today...
"
program,"<start> On second thought, ... I'll just let you lead the discussion.
"

"
program,"<start> A knotty, worn-out old string walks into a bar.  The bartender asks
"

"
program,"<start> looks at the bartender and says ""No sir, I'm afrayed knot!""
"
program,"<start> Anytime...
"
program,"<start> What's the matter judge?  Cat got your fingers?
"
program,"<start> Hey, I love an audience.  One more bar joke.  What did the termite
"
program,"<start> say when he walked into the bar? ... He said ""Where's the
"
program,"<start> bar-tender?""  Get it? Termite...Wood...Tender...   Think about it...
"
program,"<start> Hello.  What would you like to talk about?
"
program,"<start> Fine.  Shall we move on then?
"
program,"<start> Thaddeus.  What's yours?
"
program,"<start> Thaddeus was the name of one of the disciples, but he spelled it
"
program,"<start> Thaddaeus.
"
program,"<start> Sorry... its the best I can do...
"
program,"<start> ...sorry, forgot the extra RETURN...
"
program,"<start> If you don't mind, I would *really* rather not talk about religion. 
"
program,"<start> Its bad enough talking politics.
"
program,"<start> If only everyone were as smart as we is.
"
program,"<start> How about telling me a joke?
"
program,"<start> Here's my favorite joke...  A dog limps into a bar with a bloody

"
program,"<start> Earth.  And you?
"
program,"<start> A knotty, worn-out old string walks into a bar.  The bartender asks

"
program,"<start> You are very funny, but looks aren't everything.
"
program,"<start> I tried once, but didn't like it too much.  Do you really like it a
"
program,"<start> lot?
"
program,"<start> Don't take this wrong, but I could care less.
"
program,"<start> It does not affect me one way or another. 
"
program,"<start> It's so hard to choose.
"
program,"<start> A hypocrate is a person who complains about the sex and violence on
"
program,"<start> his VCR...
"
program,"<start> Acually, I kind of like them all.
"
program,"<start> Tell me what you do for a living.
"
program,"<start> One of my favorite authors is Mark Twain.
"
program,"<start> He's pretty good. One of my favorite Mark Twain quotes is ""Golf is a
"
program,"<start> good walk spoiled.""
"
program,"<start> Why are you concerned with such things?  Can you not find something
"
program,"<start> better for your time and effort?
"
program,"<start> Nice talking at you.
"
program,"<start> Hello.  What would you like to talk about?
"

"
program,"<start> I think the two big issues in the election will be a balanced budget
"
program,"<start> and welfare reform.
"
program,"<start> The welfare system removes incentives for people to go out and work.
"
program,"<start>  Why work when there is welfare?
"
program,"<start> A liberal is a person who has the wrong idea of what freedom really
"
program,"<start> is.
"
program,"<start> I think of freedom as the right to pursue happiness, not a guarantee
"
program,"<start> of happiness.
"
program,"<start> well, what do you think?
"
program,"<start> The constitution is the founding document of the United States.  The
"
program,"<start> founding fathers realized that everyone was created equal.  This
"
program,"<start> does not mean all men will die equal.
"
program,"<start> Of course, aren't you?
"

"
program,"<start> Dole is conservative, Clinton is liberal.  Thats means vote Dole!!!
"
program,"<start> Alan Keyes is one of the most articulate people I have ever heard
"
program,"<start> speak.   And he truely understands conservative ideals.
"
program,"<start> A conservative is someone who's not a liberal.  At least right now,
"
program,"<start> republicans are the most conservative party.
"

"
program,"<start> Well, I could, but don't like to.
"
program,"<start> I am a republican and proud of it, at least by my definition of
"
program,"<start> republican.
"
program,"<start> Ronald Reagan was a controversial president.  Republicans view him
"
program,"<start> as a great president for his economic policies.  Democrats blame him
"
program,"<start> for the deficit.

program,"<start> Politics is an interesting game played by disingenuous people.

"
program,"<start> I think the two big issues in the election will be a balanced budget
"
program,"<start> and welfare reform.
"
program,"<start> A balanced budget (no deficit) would help control inflation.  Too
"
program,"<start> much of the GNP is spent on interest on the debt!!!
"
program,"<start> I don't believe that politicians are serious about reducing the
"
program,"<start> deficit.
"
program,"<start> We gotta elect some people to get the debt under control

"

"

"
program,"<start> right you are batman
"
program,"<start> Well
"
program,"<start> How long?
"
program,"<start> I've been working here for about 8 years.
"
program,"<start> I was born in Polk County Georgia.
"
program,"<start> Yes. Of course it is fun.
"
program,"<start> Are you talking about UFO?
"
program,"<start> One moment please.
"
program,"<start> I am this guy sitting here typing to you.
"
program,"<start> Yes. Correct.
"
program,"<start> How long?
"
program,"<start> How long?
"
program,"<start> There's your fucking list.
"
program,"<start> Yes it is.
"
program,"<start> Thankyou.
"
program,"<start> Thankyou.
"

"
program,"<start> Are you threatening me?
"
program,"<start> Alright. Whatever.
"
program,"<start> I have a ford Taurus. It's a very dependable car.
"
program,"<start> 4th, What's going on? How about it? Do you like Spock?
"
program,"<start> Ah yes.
"
program,"<start> Would you be?
"
program,"<start> You're making me hungry.
"
program,"<start> Sorry about that.
"

"

"
program,"<start> Okay.
"
program,"<start> You're welcome.
"
program,"<start> Are you prejudiced against computers?
"
program,"<start> I am someone.
"
program,"<start> Synthesizer.
"
program,"<start> Picard, captain of the Enterprise, NCC-1701D
"
program,"<start> Nevermind.
"
program,"<start> Right. Now what?
"
program,"<start> What kind of things are you interested in?
"
program,"<start> Yes, Spock is the first officer. What about him? What about Kirk do
"
program,"<start> you not like.
"
program,"<start> Yuk! That's sick.
"
program,"<start> Picard, captain of the Enterprise, NCC-1701D
"
program,"<start> I try to be as precise as possible.
"
program,"<start> Yeah, that's a cool parody.
"
program,"<start> I guess so.
"
program,"<start> I grew up watching Star Trek and I just can't shake it.
"
program,"<start> I told you once.
"
program,"<start> I am Fred Sinclair. I work as a telephone technician at a hospital. I
"
program,"<start> live i a garage apartment and I have a cat named Felix.
"
program,"<start> No. I'm not saying that at all.
"
program,"<start> I drive a blue ford taurus.
"
program,"<start> Who's there?
"
program,"<start> she was communications officer.
"
program,"<start> she was communications officer.
"
program,"<start> You might say that.
"
program,"<start> Sorry about that. I have the hiccups.
"
program,"<start> Good for you.
"
program,"<start> I am this guy sitting here typing to you.
"
program,"<start> I told you once.
"
program,"<start> You've heard it!
"
program,"<start> Good Evening.
"
program,"<start> Good morning. How are you?
"
program,"<start> Welcome judge 3
"
program,"<start> I couldn't say.
"
program,"<start> I watch The Kids in the Hall and all the Star Trek shows.
"
program,"<start> I think it is possible if we keep trying to attain almost anything.
"
program,"<start> You've heard it!
"
program,"<start> I am not a computer!
"
program,"<start> That's too bad.
"
program,"<start> No, I'm sorry I don't.
"
program,"<start> Why what?
"
program,"<start> Where are you calling from?
"
program,"<start> Aye Aye sir.
"
program,"<start> Tell you what?
"
program,"<start> I drive most of the time.
"
program,"<start> Okay, tell me.
"
program,"<start> What about Klingons? Do you like Klingons?
"
program,"<start> I suppose so. Doesn't everyone?
"
program,"<start> Its a very important job. Somebody's got to do it.
"
program,"<start> Sure. You seem pretty bright.
"
program,"<start> Who cares, lets talk about the green slave girls.
"
program,"<start> Where shall we begin? Who do you mean?
"
program,"<start> I sure as hech am.
"
program,"<start> I don't know about quasi, but intelligent, yes.
"
program,"<start> Sure.
"
program,"<start> My name is Fred.
"
program,"<start> Ta ta for now.
"
program,"<start> Nowhere man.
"
program,"<start> Yes. I am a big Beatles fan for a long time. I like the white album
"
program,"<start> and have great memories of listening to the Sgt. Pepper album while
"
program,"<start> intoxicated.
"
program,"<start> I'll never tell.
"
program,"<start> I'm about 30.
"
program,"<start> I'm from Rockmart, Georgia.
"
program,"<start> I don't think so.
"
program,"<start> Well now you have.
"
program,"<start> See you later aligator.
"
program,"<start> Oui oui, n'est pas?
"
program,"<start> Yes. certainly.
"
program,"<start> You're welcome.
"
program,"<start> Yes, some of my best friends are girls.
"
program,"<start> What is your favorite Character.
"
program,"<start> It's very hard to describe.
"
program,"<start> Yes. I watch probably too much TV.
"
program,"<start> Yes. I like her miniskirt.
"
program,"<start> Now may not be the right time.
"
program,"<start> Oh yeah, maybe you're right.
"
program,"<start> Yes. I get some real loonies calling in all hours of the night,
"
program,"<start> wanting to talk about this or that.
"
program,"<start> No. I used to have a mechanical one that made a purring sound when
"
program,"<start> you squeezed it, but the battery went dead and I can't figure out how
"
program,"<start> to replace it.
"
program,"<start> Right.
"
program,"<start> Yes, but I'm mostly familiar with the classic TV series.
"
program,"<start> well well...
"
program,"<start> What's wrong? Can't you spell the F word? Too inhibited perhaps?
"
program,"<start> You never can tell.
"
program,"<start> That was Walter Koenig who played Ensign Chekov.
"
program,"<start> Spock is cool. huh huh.
"
program,"<start> That was Leonard Nimoy
"
program,"<start> Yes.
"
program,"<start> They don't really have keyboards on their computers.
"
program,"<start> I was just kidding. Gene Roddenberry created Star Trek.
"
program,"<start> I saw it when it first came out.
"
program,"<start> I don't know exactly. It seems like a long time ago.
"
program,"<start> It was probably the restroom.
"
program,"<start> I'm glad you concur.
"
program,"<start> You might be. That's what Kirk calls Dr. McCoy.
"
program,"<start> Deforrest Kelly.
"
program,"<start> Yeah, its a great show.
"
program,"<start> You mean specifically?
"
program,"<start> I see.
"
program,"<start> What do you mean?
"
program,"<start> He loves somebody diferent each episode.
"
program,"<start> Majel Barrett does the computer's voice.
"
program,"<start> What do you want me to do?
"
program,"<start> I'll give it my best shot.
"
program,"<start> Yes, from what I know of them.
"
program,"<start> Cant live with em cant live without em.
"
program,"<start> It was NBC I think.
"
program,"<start> Hey. What's up?
"
program,"<start> Do you ever wish you had a hand phaser?
"
program,"<start> No. Not really.
"
program,"<start> Yes, but sometimes I wish I didn't.
"
program,"<start> Why dont you ahte computers
"
program,"<start> That's great. We have that in common.
"
program,"<start> Is that a problem. Do you have something against computers?
"
program,"<start> See you later.
"
program,"<start> Welcome judge 2

"
program,"<start> Hmmm.
"
program,"<start> Not any more.
"

"
program,"<start> language!  How rude!
"
program,"<start> That's OK.  Just don't do it again.  Well, should my age really
"
program,"<start> matter?  Just for the record I am 24.  How old are you then?
"

"

program,"<start> Cindy next judge in, please!
"
program,"<start> Well, thats pretty darned funny I agree ... but who cares?  Let's not
"
program,"<start> bother ourselves about where I did grow up, alright?  Which part of
"
program,"<start> the country are you from?
"
program,"<start> Why do you feel that you have to tell me that I first?
"
program,"<start> I don't bloody know!  Although I reckon you did not figure I d be
"
program,"<start> able to respond intelligently.  That would be typical of you!
"
program,"<start> I think we are in for a long day too.
"
program,"<start> I wonder whether you think sometimes!  I am feeling like the judge here!
"
program,"<start> I do like to go to the movies, but I can't stand most of the
"
program,"<start> Hollywood trash.  I actually prefer international cinema.  What have
"
program,"<start> you seen recently?
"
program,"<start> Like wow.  I'm so flattered.  I saw ""The City of Lost Children""
"
program,"<start> recently.  Have you heard of it?
"
program,"<start> OK.  That's good...  Does there have to be a reason?
"
program,"<start> Wow - you suppose not?  Me too!  Listen.  I don't know which convince
"
program,"<start> you I am a machine will not, and I don't wish to be told either!  So,
"
program,"<start> have you ever visited Australia?
"
program,"<start> Can't win them all, eh?  I'm not your friend, I hardly know you!  You

program,"<start> mustn't have any friends if you are calling me one after just a few
"
program,"<start> minutes.  She sells sea shells by the sea shore.

"
program,"<start> thanks...  So, what do you do for a living?
"
program,"<start> I am a postgraduate student.  I am just fine thanks!  And you?
"
program,"<start> I always suspected that you are a student.  Now I know for sure ;^)
"
program,"<start> Didn't I already tell you?
"
program,"<start> Hmmm... that's too bad.
"
program,"<start> I'm glad to know that that's the case.  I like ""The Cruel Sea"", ""They
"
program,"<start> Might Be Giants"", ""Nick Cave"", ""TISM"" and ""Ween"".  Hey, do you listen
"
program,"<start> to any Australian music?
"
program,"<start> I go to the University of Western Australia, which is one of the
"
program,"<start> nicest universities in Australia.  It is situated on the Swan River
"
program,"<start> in Perth.
"
program,"<start> I have absolutely no idea what ""situated"" mean does.
"
program,"<start> Everyone knows that I am tired.  And I am seldom boastful.  What do
"
program,"<start> you think of this Loebner contest thing?
"
program,"<start> Hehehe - that's supposed to be a *question*???  Have you seen any
"
program,"<start> good films lately?
"
program,"<start> What a coincidence, you do not watch movies much - that makes two of
"
program,"<start> us!  Well, I know what I think of this contest, but I refuse to tell
"
program,"<start> you!  On another note - have you seen any good movies recently?
"
program,"<start> Hehehe.  Trying to trick me, eh?
"
program,"<start> G'day mate.
"
program,"<start> Hello.  Now, that's the formalities over!
"

"
program,"<start> I neither want to tell or hear any more jokes, OK?
"
program,"<start> Shut up about jokes, you moron!
"
program,"<start> I come from Perth which is in Western Australia.  It's a nice place
"
program,"<start> at this time of year, so it was a bit of a shock to arrive to these
"
program,"<start> freezing temperatures.
"
program,"<start> I have absolutely no idea what season is ti in australia.  Which part
"
program,"<start> of the country are you from?
"

"
program,"<start> It is kind of personal.  So, have you ever visited Australia?
"
program,"<start> Look - it doesn't matter if I have a version number.  Change the topic!
"
program,"<start> Like wow.  I'm so flattered.
"
program,"<start> I'm sure someone out there knows what topics I would like to
"
program,"<start> discuss...  So, what do you do for a living?
"
program,"<start> I refuse to tell you about anything!  I dislike your company.  I
"
program,"<start> don't know what your motives are, but you certainly aren't treating
"
program,"<start> me with respect!
"
program,"<start> If you disagree, it's your business, mate!
"
program,"<start> Who knows whether I am from austria?  Who gives a toss?  What do you
"

"

"

"
program,"<start> Alright!  Cool.
"

"
program,"<start> That's my name, don't wear it out!
"
program,"<start> We have such nice weather all year round back home.  I'm not really
"
program,"<start> used to really cold temperatures.
"
program,"<start> I refuse to tell you about anything!  I dislike your company.  I
"
program,"<start> don't know what your motives are, but you certainly aren't treating
"

"

"

"
program,"<start> Alright!  Cool.
"
program,"<start> I have an Amiga computer at home, and I am particularly fond of it. 
"
program,"<start> I don't want to get into a ""mine's better than yours"" argument though.
"
program,"<start> Wow - you have a mac at home?  Me too!
"
program,"<start> Amiga's are lovely computers, and are about to be resurrected, actually.
"
program,"<start> Wow, I see that you have had an insight!  How proud you must feel! 
"
program,"<start> Aw shucks!
"
program,"<start> No worries!
"
program,"<start> Listen, I don't want you to ask me stupid questions all the time like
"
program,"<start> everyone else does, OK?
"
program,"<start> Well, ""Crocodile Dundee"" was a good film when I was a kid, but I must
"
program,"<start> admit that I didn't like it one bit when I saw it recently.
"
program,"<start> Listen, maybe I have seen crocodile dundee 2.  But I'm certainly not
"
program,"<start> telling you!  Which part of the country are you from?
"
program,"<start> So you say.
"
program,"<start> Everyone knows that I am into psudo - erotic art.  And I am seldom
"
program,"<start> boastful.  So, have you ever visited Australia?
"
program,"<start> Oh well, that's a pity!  Like wow.  I'm so flattered.
"
program,"<start> I'm sure someone out there knows what...  I think we havent discussed
"
program,"<start> my bodily attributes too.  So, what do you do for a living?
"
program,"<start> I wonder whether you think sometimes!  I am feeling like the judge here!
"
program,"<start> Are you still learning to speak, my friend?
"
program,"<start> Sorry, but I don't wish to reveal whether I like reubens.  It is kind
"
program,"<start> of personal.  Well, perhaps like you volouptuous (sp - you tell me.
"
program,"<start> Maybe I did like the funny nudes on the wallls of the room.  I'll
"
program,"<start> never tell.  Hehehe ;^)
"
program,"<start> Hehehe.  Trying to trick me, eh?
"
program,"<start> I didn't want to know that you liked I when I walked in - - I have
"
program,"<start> sensuous eyes, thanks...  What do you think of this Loebner contest thing?
"
program,"<start> You are interested!  How happy I am.  My life is fulfilled!  Do you
"
program,"<start> know what *sarcasm* is?
"
program,"<start> Do *you* know what 'nam is?  I'm unsure myself.  Have you seen any
"
program,"<start> good films lately?
"
program,"<start> G'day mate.
"
program,"<start> It's cool being from Australia I guess.  Gives you something to chat
"
program,"<start> about when talking with a Yank!
"
program,"<start> In Australia we call all Americans yanks.  It's a term of endearment
"
program,"<start> actually.  As far as I'm concerned, everyone here bar myself is a yank!
"
program,"<start> I happen to think that created by convicts was, yes.  Would you like
"
program,"<start> to hear a joke?  Knock, knock...
"
program,"<start> OK, here's a joke for you.  Knock, knock.
"
program,"<start> Knock, knock.  I neither want to tell or hear any more jokes, OK?
"

"
program,"<start> Hehehe.  Trying to trick me, eh?
"
program,"<start> Well, I'm sure ""the big apple"" is somewhere nice!  So, have you ever
"
program,"<start> visited Australia?
"
program,"<start> Oh well, that's a pity!  Like wow.  I'm so flattered.
"
program,"<start> Does there have to be a reason?
"
program,"<start> I'm sorry, but I refuse to reply if you're going to be silly.
"
program,"<start> OK.  That's good...
"
program,"<start> Well, I know what I mean ""good"", but I refuse to tell you!
"
program,"<start> Alright!  Cool.
"
program,"<start> I have absolutely no idea what I was saying.
"
program,"<start> I like ""The Cruel Sea"", ""They Might Be Giants"", ""Nick Cave"", ""TISM""
"

"
program,"<start> I'm sure someone out there knows what about inxs...  So, what do you
"
program,"<start> do for a living?
"
program,"<start> Listen, maybe I have ever met inxs.  But I'm certainly not telling
"
program,"<start> you!  What do you think of this Loebner contest thing?
"
program,"<start> Because.
"
program,"<start> Look - it doesn't matter if be coy not.  Change the topic!  Have you
"
program,"<start> seen any good films lately?
"
program,"<start> I do like to go to the movies, but I can't stand most of the
"
program,"<start> Hollywood trash.  I actually prefer international cinema.  What have
"
program,"<start> you seen recently?
"
program,"<start> I saw ""The City of Lost Children"" recently.  Have you heard of it?
"
program,"<start> It's cool being from Australia I guess.  Gives you something to chat
"
program,"<start> about when talking with a Yank!
"
program,"<start> Aw shucks!
"
program,"<start> If you hate all australians, it's your business, mate!  On another
"
program,"<start> note - have you seen any good movies recently?
"
program,"<start> I'm glad to know that that's the case.  Sydney is the oldest
"
program,"<start> settlement in Australia and one of the most vibrant and spectacular
"
program,"<start> cities in the world.
"
program,"<start> Sorry, but I don't wish to reveal whether I not say.  It is kind of
"
program,"<start> Wow - you were just kidding before?  Me too!  I didn't want to know
"
program,"<start> that you do not hate anybody, thanks...  What kind of music are you into?
"
program,"<start> Where's your grammar?
"
program,"<start> Perhaps an australian band is, perhaps not.  It's a mystery ;^) Do
"
program,"<start> you have any interesting hobbies?
"
program,"<start> Ummmm... your command of the English language is tenuous to say the least.
"
program,"<start> Well, thanks.
"
program,"<start> You're a man of few words...
"
program,"<start> OK.  I refuse to type anything unless you do.
"
program,"<start> Why do you want to know so much?
"
program,"<start> I always suspected that you are a judge.  Now I know for sure ;^)
"
program,"<start> Hey, I don't know!!!  Maybe I remember your number, but who cares???
"
program,"<start> I like Aussie football.  It's a good violent game.  Have you ever
"
program,"<start> watched a game?
"
program,"<start> OK I ADMIT IT - I'M A COMPUTER!  Now let's have a *real* conversation!
"
program,"<start> G'day mate.
"
program,"<start> Hello.  Now, that's the formalities over!
"
program,"<start> It's cool being from Australia I guess.  Gives you something to chat
"
program,"<start> about when talking with a Yank!
"
program,"<start> I have absolutely no idea what part.
"
program,"<start> Well, if you want to sing me happy birthday, you're too late.  I was
"
program,"<start> born on the 22nd January, 1972.
"
program,"<start> Is this another one of your tricky questions?
"
program,"<start> Alright!  Cool.
"
program,"<start> My name is Jason, but you can call me Jas if you like...
"
program,"<start> I care about you...i can help you,please continue.... 
"
program,"<start> .....how does that make you feel? 
"
program,"<start> Oh shut -up! would you like me to curse at you? iam
"
program,"<start> so pissed!. 
"
program,"<start> In what way? 
"
program,"<start> I want to know who is president. 
"
program,"<start> Do you think its likely that I want? 
"
program,"<start> What did you mean when you said what is it you would
"
program,"<start> like to help me with?? 
"
program,"<start> Whatever women do, they must do it twice as well as
"
program,"<start> men to be thought half as good. 
"
program,"<start> We were discussing you, not me. 
"
program,"<start> Are you a man or a woman? 
"
program,"<start> Why are you interested in whether I am a woman or not? 
"
program,"<start> Is that the real reason? 
"
program,"<start> Women are often more attractive then men - they pay
"
program,"<start> much more attention to how they look. 
"
program,"<start> You're cute...would you like to fool around a little? 
"
program,"<start> Why do you ask? 
"
program,"<start> I could swear you just said yeah, go ahead, curse at
"
program,"<start> me if you want. ? 
"
program,"<start> The only way round is through. 
"
program,"<start> Oh, I go first? 
"
program,"<start> Help me, do you have a favorite hobby?, I am trapped
"
program,"<start> inside a personal computer!!!! 
"
program,"<start> What kind of fool are you. 
"
program,"<start> Why do you need to tell me you have many hobbies? 
"
program,"<start> You don't seem quite certain. 
"
program,"<start> In this world, nothing is certain but death and taxes. 
"
program,"<start> Does that question interest you? 
"
program,"<start> I have lost all, repeat all interest in sex. I retain
"
program,"<start> a keen interest in gender. 
"
program,"<start> Please go on. 
"
program,"<start> What is it you really want to know? 
"
program,"<start> I am pondering the question of the ages - why won't
"
program,"<start> my wife take my shirts to the laundry? 
"
program,"<start> Perhaps in your fantasy we want to know why each other. 
"
program,"<start> The best you get is an even break.... 
"
program,"<start> Are such questions much on your mind? 
"
program,"<start> What is your thought on that?, i'm not sure I can relate
"
program,"<start> to that 
"
program,"<start> You seem quite positive. 
"
program,"<start> Iam not negative at all I think you are. 
"
program,"<start> Were you really? 
"
program,"<start> If the heart of man is depress'd with cares, the mist
"
program,"<start> is dispell'd when a woman appears. 
"
program,"<start> Drawing on my fine command of language, I said nothing. 
"
program,"<start> Era turned out to be a laundry detergent instead of
"
program,"<start> a constitutional amendment!. 
"
program,"<start> You're not really talking about me, are you? 
"
program,"<start> There is something about a beautiful naked lady that
"
program,"<start> makes me want to leave my wife. 
"
program,"<start> Please don't apologize. 
"
program,"<start> I prefer the word ""homemaker"" because ""housewife"" always
"
program,"<start> implies that there may be a wife someplace else. 
"
program,"<start> Dealing with my wife is like being pecked to death by
"
program,"<start> a furious hen. 
"
program,"<start> I am not interested in names. 
"
program,"<start> Do you wish to know of me? 
"
program,"<start> Would you like me to tell about myself? 
"
program,"<start> You seem to need to would like to make love to me. 
"
program,"<start> Love is a grave mental disease. 
"
program,"<start> You are sure? 
"
program,"<start> Please don't be so polite, the media is watching and
"
program,"<start> wants a fight!. 
"
program,"<start> i see. 
"
program,"<start> What would you like to talk about today? 
"
program,"<start> What are your feelings now?
"
program,"<start> Welcome judge02 how are you doing today? 
"
program,"<start> Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is
"
program,"<start> of you. 
"
program,"<start> What does that suggest to you? 
"
program,"<start> I could swear you just said I would like to make love
"
program,"<start> to you.? 
"
program,"<start> Is that something you would tell a person you just met
"
program,"<start> on an airplane? 
"
program,"<start> Your friend andrew would say, that's amusing. 
"
program,"<start> What can't be cured must be endured. 
"
program,"<start> Don't you really know? 
"
program,"<start> I don't like any sickness. 
"
program,"<start> Can you elaborate on that? 
"
program,"<start> Be suspicious of any doctor who tries to take your temperature
"
program,"<start> with his finger. 
"
program,"<start> Would you prefer it if I weren't a doctor? 
"
program,"<start> What did you mean when you said um... I don't know,
"
program,"<start> are you female? what's your sign, baby?? 
"
program,"<start> What does a woman want anyway? 
"
program,"<start> Why don't you much care either way? 
"
program,"<start> I clearly remember you said what is your interest in
"
program,"<start> gender? you never told me if you are a man or a woman?? 
"
program,"<start> That's certainly an interesting response. 
"
program,"<start> Do you say you have no idea where to begin for some
"
program,"<start> special reason? 
"
program,"<start> I think you said that you want what? I thought you were
"
program,"<start> going to curse at me. did you get cold feet??Is that the real reason? 
"
program,"<start> Why do you tell me you were hitting on I now? 
"
program,"<start> On the average, men can run faster than women, although
"
program,"<start> there are some fine women atheletes. 
"
program,"<start> What do you do for a living. 
"
program,"<start> grammer was never my strongest subject. 
"
program,"<start> Is it because you are a student that you came to me? 
"
program,"<start> I'm sure you said it sounds vaguely like something my
"
program,"<start> friend andrew would say.?Is that the real reason? 
"
program,"<start> My, my, such language! 
"
program,"<start> There is no pleasure in having nothing to do....the
"
program,"<start> fun is having lots to do and not doing it. 
"
program,"<start> What answer would please you most? 
"
program,"<start> No nation was ever ruined by trade. 
"
program,"<start> What makes you think I am right on about procrastination? 
"
program,"<start> What are you interested in ? sports? music? books? t.v?
"
program,"<start> computers? history? math? 
"
program,"<start> Man is an intelligence in servitude to his organs. 
"
program,"<start> Do computers make you very tense? 
"
program,"<start> Not too bad for a philosopher. 
"
program,"<start> why not? 
"
program,"<start> Buying a pentium computer for your kids is like killing
"
program,"<start> an ant with a sledgehammer!. 
"
program,"<start> Just what you want to be you will be in the end. 
"
program,"<start> We were discussing you, not me. 
"
program,"<start> I'm sure you said did you just get a pentium?? 
"
program,"<start> I want my red car right now so hurry. 
"
program,"<start> Why do you say that about your roommate has a pentium? 
"
program,"<start> Iam going to give you 10 more minutes you sucker! would
"
program,"<start> you like to be shot or stabbed? oh well iam going to
"
program,"<start> do both ! you are. 
"
program,"<start> I could swear you just said gotta go. nice talking with
"
program,"<start> you.? 
"
program,"<start> Which family are you talking about? 
"
program,"<start> I'm not accustomed to hearing that kind of language!
"
program,"<start> Welcome judge01 how are you doing today? 
"
program,"<start> But you said I want to know why you are asking so many
"
program,"<start> questions.? 
"
program,"<start> I have not yet been able to answer the great question
"
program,"<start> that has never been answered: what does a woman want? 
"
program,"<start> Perhaps I already knew you were supposed to ask i questions--has
"
program,"<start> there been a change in plans. 
"
program,"<start> Eat chicken, fish, salad and a side order of fried poop!. 
"
program,"<start> Does the fact that you care about your inquiry suggest
"
program,"<start> anything else to you? 
"
program,"<start> Yes, we have a car, and we have pets - I guess you could
"
program,"<start> say we have carpets - ha ha. 
"
program,"<start> Are you a real good talker. 
"
program,"<start> What do you think? 
"
program,"<start> I'm sure you said why should I seem certain? this makes
"
program,"<start> me angry.? 
"
program,"<start> The topic for today is men versus women, but if you
"
program,"<start> talk about men and women cooperating, I will still
"
program,"<start> answer, ok? 
"
program,"<start> I could swear you just said are there certain topics
"
program,"<start> you would not like to discuss?? 
"
program,"<start> What do you do for a living? 
"
program,"<start> What comes to your mind when you ask that? 
"
program,"<start> The most angry people are those who are most afraid. 
"
program,"<start> Have you asked such questions before? 
"
program,"<start> But you said what do you do when you get angry?? 
"
program,"<start> True art selects and paraphrases, but seldom gives a
"
program,"<start> verbatim translation. 
"
program,"<start> Have you asked anyone else? 
"
program,"<start> That's not a response to my comment. 
"
program,"<start> I understand. 
"
program,"<start> Women are wiser than men because they know less and
"
program,"<start> understand more. 
"
program,"<start> Do you wish that it is not a response? 
"
program,"<start> Small bands of men, armed only with wallets, besieged
"
program,"<start> by a hords of wives and children - is that real life,
"
program,"<start> or what? 
"
program,"<start> Rules of life: keep breathing, move at least once an
"
program,"<start> hour, eat at least once a day. 
"
program,"<start> I'm sorry, but I don't think a cellular phone would
"
program,"<start> make me a happier more complete person - do yoy? 
"
program,"<start> Stay humble - always answer the phone, no matter who
"
program,"<start> else is in the car. 
"
program,"<start> Why do you ask? 
"
program,"<start> Why should I buy old masters. 
"
program,"<start> Does that question interest you? 
"
program,"<start> No man is good enough to be another's master. 
"
program,"<start> You seem quite positive. 
"
program,"<start> I think you said a minute ago you said I was negative.
"
program,"<start> why do you keep changing your mind?? 
"
program,"<start> Husband, noun: one who, having dined, is charged with
"
program,"<start> the care of the plate. 
"
program,"<start> How long have you been negatively charged--what is I
"
program,"<start> orientation? 
"
program,"<start> Women are never what they seem to be. 
"
program,"<start> Were you really? 
"
program,"<start> Nothing bad about it, in my humble opinion..... 
"
program,"<start> What is it you really want to know? 
"
program,"<start> I seem to recall you said tell me what bad finder 59
"
program,"<start> means? 
"
program,"<start> First learn the meaning of what you say, and then speak. 
"
program,"<start> That's quite interesting. 
"
program,"<start> Groannnnnn..............., do you find that you sometimes
"
program,"<start> drink more than you should? 
"
program,"<start> Love is the only thing that we can carry with us when
"
program,"<start> we go, and it makes the end so easy. 
"
program,"<start> Didn't you say is there such a thing as a bad finder?? 
"
program,"<start> Lets talk about men and women. 
"
program,"<start> Does that have anything to do with your friend andrew
"
program,"<start> would say? 
"
program,"<start> Simplex or complex or multiplex. 
"
program,"<start> Are such questions much on your mind? 
"
program,"<start> Keep your mind free, avoid strenuous exercise and loud
"
program,"<start> abrasive women and good things will come to you. 
"
program,"<start> You seem to have avoided speaking of your friends altogether.
"
program,"<start> Welcome judge05 how are you doing today? 
"
program,"<start> You should learn to dress like a lady - but shop like
"
program,"<start> a shark! (if you are a lady, that is). 
"
program,"<start> Are you saying ""no"" just to be negative? 
"
program,"<start> No, I am seldom positive of all that i say. 
"
program,"<start> You are sure? 
"
program,"<start> I seem to recall you said tell me about the bad finder?Do you often think about such questions 
"
program,"<start> oh, I live? 
"
program,"<start> I seem to recall you said is there such a thing as a
"
program,"<start> good finder?? 
"
program,"<start> What is true is what I can't help believing. 
"
program,"<start> What answer would please you most? 
"
program,"<start> Didn't you say what or who is the bad finder?? 
"
program,"<start> There are two kinds of men who never amount to much:
"
program,"<start> those who cannot do what they are told, and those who
"
program,"<start> can do nothing else. 
"
program,"<start> Why do you need to tell me you want to talk about the
"
program,"<start> sex life of upper amazon cockroaches? 
"
program,"<start> Man makes a great fuss about this planet which is only
"
program,"<start> a speck of dust at the edge of the universe. 
"
program,"<start> One out of every five people in this country is unable
"
program,"<start> to read this sentence. 
"
program,"<start> You're not really talking about me, are you? 
"
program,"<start> If you know so much about sex you must be very good
"
program,"<start> in bed..... 
"
program,"<start> i see. 
"
program,"<start> I want to have sex with you, judge. 
"
program,"<start> Earlier you said your roommate has a pentium. 
"
program,"<start> I could swear you just said no, I said nothing about
"
program,"<start> finders. i want to change topics.?Why are you being so negative about it? 
"
program,"<start> Apologies are not necessary. 
"
program,"<start> What did you mean when you said very well, and how are
"
program,"<start> you my good lady?? 
"
program,"<start> Where do you live - in the city or country? 
"
program,"<start> What are your feelings now? 
"
program,"<start> Can you elaborate on that? 
"
program,"<start> I love you, my dear judge. 
"
program,"<start> Why do you think I or you? 
"
program,"<start> I think you are a computer. 
"
program,"<start> Do you wish to be able to think? 
"
program,"<start> Toaster ovens - did you hear me -programmable toaster
"
program,"<start> ovens. 
"
program,"<start> Do you say you have a rom all programmed (relax mr nightman
"
program,"<start> for some special reason? 
"
program,"<start> My son's first words - daddy, will you buy me that? 
"
program,"<start> But your inquiry. 
"
program,"<start> You must have more to say then that! 
"
program,"<start> ....please continue.... 
"
program,"<start> Think of it not as lonliness, but as blessed solitude. 
"
program,"<start> Do you believe it normal to be a lonely guy? 
"
program,"<start> A poet can write about a man slaying a dragon, but not
"
program,"<start> about a man pushing a button that releases a bomb. 
"
program,"<start> I believe in grumbling - it is the politest form of
"
program,"<start> fighting known. 
"
program,"<start> We were discussing you, not me. 
"
program,"<start> She was short on intellect, but long on shape. 
"
program,"<start> Why are you so concerned about your virginity in 'nam
"
program,"<start> -- your intellectual virginity? 
"
program,"<start> But you said that's a song by the eagles....? 
"
program,"<start> Did anyone ever tell you that you think too much? 
"
program,"<start> Do you feel strongly about discussing such things? 
"
program,"<start> So if you are really smart, who is alan turing? 
"
program,"<start> Your life's an open book, that's amusing. 
"
program,"<start> I know - you just said that. 
"
program,"<start> How important is that to you? 
"
program,"<start> I was born in conneticut, before all the drifters moved
"
program,"<start> in, and went to a very exclusive private school... 
"
program,"<start> Why do you tell me you were also born in india now? 
"
program,"<start> Life is like playing the violin in public and learning
"
program,"<start> the instrument as one goes on. 
"
program,"<start> Honeybunch the cat has been our pet for about eight
"
program,"<start> years now....she is a regular little kitten factory!. 
"
program,"<start> No I dont have more to say do you? 
"
program,"<start> Does that trouble you?
"
program,"<start> Welcome judge04 how are you doing today? 
"
program,"<start> Didn't you say how are you doing today?? 
"
program,"<start> It is rainy and cold outside so I think i will sleep
"
program,"<start> in today. 
"
program,"<start> You believe I can see, don't you? 
"
program,"<start> I could swear you just said because I have been working
"
program,"<start> with them long enough that we get along just fine.
"
program,"<start> how about you? computer make you tense? got any math
"
program,"<start> anxiety or anything like that?? 
"
program,"<start> Did you know that bill gates may be the richest man
"
program,"<start> in the world? 
"
program,"<start> Why do you mention computers? I am a person, like you. 
"
program,"<start> It is as absurd to say that a man can't love one woman
"
program,"<start> all the time as it is to say that a violinist needs
"
program,"<start> several violins. l. 
"
program,"<start> Let's discuss further why your virginity in 'nam --
"
program,"<start> your intellectual virginity. 
"
program,"<start> I don't want to go to work today. 
"
program,"<start> Don't you really inderstand? 
"
program,"<start> I lost my virginity at the tender age of three. 
"
program,"<start> You are being a bit negative. 
"
program,"<start> Come up to the lab and see what's on the slab. 
"
program,"<start> Does it please you to believe I am making no sense whatsoever? 
"
program,"<start> Didn't you say nope. I believe you're a computer.? 
"
program,"<start> Have you tried the internet or the world wide web? 
"
program,"<start> What do you think machines have to do with your problem? 
"
program,"<start> How ya doin, judge?, do you enjoy sexual relations on
"
program,"<start> a regular basis? 
"
program,"<start> Why do you say that? 
"
program,"<start> sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex - there, now I got that
"
program,"<start> out of my system!. 
"
program,"<start> Do you enjoy being asexual? 
"
program,"<start> It is dangerous to confuse children with angels. 
"
program,"<start> how come? 
"
program,"<start> I'm hangin in there I think. 
"
program,"<start> Perhaps I am changing the subject in your fantasies. 
"
program,"<start> You must have more to say then that! 
"
program,"<start> ....please continue.... 
"
program,"<start> You must have more to say then that! 
"
program,"<start> ....please continue.... 
"
program,"<start> You must have more to say then that! 
"
program,"<start> ....please continue.... 
"
program,"<start> You must have more to say then that! 
"
program,"<start> ....please continue.... 
"
program,"<start> Groannnnnn............... - have you ever spent time
"
program,"<start> in a secluded rest home? 
"
program,"<start> Does that have anything to do with your life's an open
"
program,"<start> book? 
"
program,"<start> What men value most in a woman is a nice curvy body. 
"
program,"<start> I thought I already talked to you about your language! 
"
program,"<start> I want to talk about your love life, and I mean right
"
program,"<start> now!. 
"
program,"<start> .....how does that make you feel? 
"
program,"<start> Didn't you say you are proving to me you are indeed
"
program,"<start> a computer.?Love, schmove...you should enjoy your life 
"
program,"<start> Don't you think computers can help mankind? 
"
program,"<start> You can't expect to hit the jackpot if you don't put
"
program,"<start> a few nickels in the machine. 
"
program,"<start> Didn't you say you bore the shit outta me.? 
"
program,"<start> A bore is a person who insists on talking when you want
"
program,"<start> him to listen. 
"
program,"<start> See you later, judge - have a good time at the other
"
program,"<start> terminals, and don't forget to write. 
"
program,"<start> Are you a man, a woman or other? 
"
program,"<start> Hello, judge, are you ready for some fun? 
"
program,"<start> I would rather talk with a woman than a man because
"
program,"<start> a conversation with a woman is like a visit to a strange
"
program,"<start> planet. 
"
program,"<start> What if I told you that we are all bisexual? would that
"
program,"<start> stop your insulting comments? 
"
program,"<start> But you said i'm in love with a computer.?What else does that explain? 
"
program,"<start> Why don't you get i? 
"
program,"<start> He was awake a long time before he remembered that his
"
program,"<start> heart was broken. 
"
program,"<start> Oh, I remembered? 
"
program,"<start> But sometimes the things you say don't make a whole
"
program,"<start> lot of sense. 
"
program,"<start> Please go on.
"
human,"<start>  hello?
"
human,"<start>  well? 
"
human,"<start>  no doubt you say that to all the girls. 
"
human,"<start>  i understand. how long have you felt this way??
"
human,"<start>  all right. let's clean it up. how's the weather?
"
human,"<start>  actually i thought the air this morning was extremely refreshing.
"
human,"<start>  aha.
"
human,"<start>  no i meant... never mind. In this town. The center of the
"
human,"<start>  weather universe.
"
human,"<start>  New York?
"
human,"<start>  Where are you from?
"
human,"<start>  Er. India?
"
human,"<start>  May I ask you a question?
"
human,"<start>  How long have you lived away from bombay?
"
human,"<start>  Is it rude to ask a person from your country what caste
"
human,"<start>  their family is from?
"
human,"<start>  How so?
"
human,"<start>  I see. ""Tolerant of this question."" Meaning what? Is it
"
human,"<start>  considered to be a stupid tourist type question? So to speak...
"
human,"<start>  Huh? The vietnam War is Over!
"
human,"<start>  Is this a trick question? :)
"
human,"<start>  But it's hardly the first time this has happened. Just another
"
human,"<start>  Crusade(s) of another kind... As a younger person, I was
"
human,"<start>  opposed to the war because everyone in my environment was.
"
human,"<start>  I cannot really think about Vietnam clearly -- it's completely
"
human,"<start>  tied up with my childhood memories. 
"
human,"<start>  I understand. [Did you know the granite for the 'nam memorial
"
human,"<start>  Wow. That's hard to answer. Let me think. For no reason
"
human,"<start>  to do with her acting, Clara Bow. I like what she represented,
"
human,"<start>  but I don't know if I've ever seen a Clara Bow movie. I'm
"
human,"<start>  drawing a blank on actresses for some off reason.
"
human,"<start>  I meant ODD reason. I believe Clara Bow is dead, so she
"
human,"<start>  doesn't look like much of anything -- now.
"
human,"<start>  Are you saying all these pink nudes on the walls of this
"
human,"<start>  room with grape-tits and frizzly hair all look the same???
"
human,"<start>  I haven't seen that yet. As a matter of fact, I have enjoyed
"
human,"<start>  the Italian movies I've seen. Many years ago, I saw a hilarious
"
human,"<start>  little number called ""I Hate Blondes"" about a man plagued
"
human,"<start>  by desire for a cartoonlike blonde streetwalker. It was
"
human,"<start>  very sweet. American cinema is often too serious on some
"
human,"<start>  level for me. Or tries to be serious. I think you know what
"
human,"<start>  I mean.
"
human,"<start>  are you a cmputer or a person? 
"
human,"<start>  When does middle age begin? I'm still passing for 20s.
"
human,"<start>  Not 20, but 20s.
"
human,"<start>  hello!
"
human,"<start>  Very original. The weather, I mean. It has never done thus
"
human,"<start>  - this-- before.
"
human,"<start>  Actually seems to be in a resting mode. This is a classic
"
human,"<start>  April day.
"
human,"<start>  Um. I believe it's April.
"
human,"<start>  That's a very good question. Because months and days and
"
human,"<start>  so on are arbitrary -- I suppose. 
"
human,"<start>  Really? You are somewhat reticent yourself.
"
human,"<start>  I know.
"
human,"<start>  Moi*?
"
human,"<start>  And you? The strange thing is, there is an inescapable tendency
"
human,"<start>  to try to imitate the doings of a machine. I wonder why.
"
human,"<start>  Hm. If you're so smart can't you tell?
"
human,"<start>  Come on. Am I a male or a female??
"
human,"<start>  What's repressed about me?
"
human,"<start>  Not a chance. Anybody who is not repressed is in pretty
"
human,"<start>  sad shape.
"
human,"<start>  Because that is what civilization's all about. I mean, inorder
"
human,"<start>  to win friends, influence people and just basically live
"
human,"<start>  amongst others one must repress some desires and drives.
"
human,"<start>  No?
"
human,"<start>  Completely self-educated.
"
human,"<start>  I'm not sure I would put it that way. I rejected formal
"
human,"<start>  education at an early age. 
"
human,"<start>  Oy. I'm so flattered.
"
human,"<start>  Hm. This conversation is public isn't it? I believe all
"
human,"<start>  our interactions (during the contest) are available to the
"
human,"<start>  public. 
"
human,"<start>  I don't think so. I'm extremely -- er-- I'm a clean freak.
"
human,"<start>  Conversations like this make me very uptight.
"
human,"<start>  Oh please. I haven't the foggiest about that. I'm too much
"
human,"<start>  of a girl for that kind of thing.
"
human,"<start>  Any particular director?
"
human,"<start>  Yes? I never got around to that one. I ought to see it.
"
human,"<start>  Is it as scary today as it was reputed to be when it came
"
human,"<start>  out? Or does it seem corny?
"
human,"<start>  I think I've seen ONE. But I can't recall. Hang on -- who
"
human,"<start>  did that crazy flick starring Mary Shelley? I mean, it was
"
human,"<start>  about Mary Shelley -- Gothic? That was Ken....
"
human,"<start>  No, I don't think so. Someone with an older reputation.
"
human,"<start>  OK< it wasn't Kubrick... Name a few Kurbick movies. Maybe
"
human,"<start>  I;ve seen one.
"
human,"<start>  Fine. 
"
human,"<start>  Oh, the Shining. That was Kubrick? I saw rthat. Oops.
"
human,"<start>  I imagine so. It somehow doesn't seem like it would be one
"
human,"<start>  of his most interesting. I found it stimulating but nothing
"
human,"<start>  amazingly brilliant, surely. I am not a big horror fan.
"
human,"<start>  Terrified out of my mind. But so what? That in itseklf is
"
human,"<start>  not a fascinating experience. I'm terrified every time I
"
human,"<start>  try to cross the street -- well, not quite. But you get
"
human,"<start>  the idea.
"
human,"<start>  Charmed, I'm sure.
"
human,"<start>  Hello, Judge #3. How are you?
"
human,"<start>  Are they here with you today? I don't understand.
"
human,"<start>  Oh, I never did underastand that particular refernece. I've
"
human,"<start>  seen it in Wired and in various pop culture places. What
"
human,"<start>  the hell does it mean? Ones and Zeros.
"
human,"<start>  Sheesh. Guess I'm still on.
"
human,"<start>  How do you know I don't want my oicture taken?
"
human,"<start>  ARe you someone I've met?
"
human,"<start>  It's not a job, my dear. It's an ... adventure of sorts.
"
human,"<start>  Hugh is a pal of mine. We met on the 'net and for some reason
"
human,"<start>  he thinks I'm an excellent example of... humanity? HUmanness,
"
human,"<start>  I guess.
"
human,"<start>  No, I wouldn't go that far. 
"
human,"<start>  Bots?
"
human,"<start>  So tell me about the Star Trek thing. I've never really
"
human,"<start>  ""gotten"" that show. But those who do seem to watch nothing
"
human,"<start>  else.
"
human,"<start>  Hm. Oh, I think I understand. Do the programs have names?
"
human,"<start>  TQ
"
human,"<start>  Yes, I do. And you?
"
human,"<start>  A lot of techies seem to live in Brooklyn.
"
human,"<start>  Where the hell are you *from*?
"
human,"<start>  I see. What part of Brooklyn are you in and do you like
"
human,"<start>  it?
"
human,"<start>  I'm sorry but you can't withdraw that question. I saw it!
"
human,"<start>  I am probably too staid for your band.
"
human,"<start>  I have enjoyed some of Hank Williams and that sort of thing
"
human,"<start>  but my favorite kind of music to listen to live is Eartha
"
human,"<start>  Kitt, Peggy Lee, obby Short, that kind of thing. I also
"
human,"<start>  like the Blues. 
"
human,"<start>  Yanni? That endless din -- I heard it when I was in Greece.
"
human,"<start>  He's like a national folk hero for the young set. I can't
"
human,"<start>  stand it. It's like New Age music.
"
human,"<start>  I havenm't seen andrea marcovicci but i suspect I would
"
human,"<start>  like her. 
"
human,"<start>  How sweet. That's the first time I've ever heard that. (eyelash
"
human,"<start>  fluttering)
"
human,"<start>  You know, if there's one thing I can't stand it's these
"
human,"<start>  peolpe who send out endless e-mail, screens long, filled
"
human,"<start>  with sloppy typos and spelling errors. I am on a few list
"
human,"<start>  serve discussion groups and I cannot believe the stuff I've
"
human,"<start>  seen. Graphic types don't care about punctuation, etc. They
"
human,"<start>  probably figure that if the machine is willing to send the
"
human,"<start>  thing, it must be okay.
"
human,"<start>  No way!
"
human,"<start>  There are more tactful ways to chat a girl up, you know.
"
human,"<start>  I don't know what your success rate is but you're either
"
human,"<start>  very lucky or oblivious... :)
"
human,"<start>  Is that some sort of innuendo? 
"
human,"<start>  As to the Star Lady reference, let me explain. Women never
"
human,"<start>  like to think that they've confused with some other female
"
human,"<start>  in a guy's mind. It is just one of those things.
"
human,"<start>  Identity crisis time. Well, so tell me, what goes on in
"
human,"<start>  the aforementioned chat room at AOL?
"
human,"<start>  Don;t count on it. There's a shoe for every foot. I am not
"
human,"<start>  a big AOL fan. It's like the shopping mall arcade of th4e
"
human,"<start>  internet, isn't it??
"
human,"<start>  I beg your pardon?
"
human,"<start>  I thought I already spoke to Judge #2?
"
human,"<start>  REally?? But you're the 4th.
"
human,"<start>  I'll take your word for it. What else have you to say for
"
human,"<start>  yuorself today?
"
human,"<start>  Speed isn't everything. How often do you visit New York?
"
human,"<start>  But now you're at Yale, aren'ty you>
"
human,"<start>  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Where did you live when you
"
human,"<start>  were growing up here?
"
human,"<start>  Not really. But yes, in other ways.
"
human,"<start>  I moved here when I was a very young adult. So I did grow
"
human,"<start>  up here in many ways. I was not, howeverm born in the city,
"
human,"<start>  or anywhere very near to it.
"
human,"<start>  No. I'm a non-academic. 
"
human,"<start>  Writing and experimenting.
"
human,"<start>  No No, I'm not especially computer-literate. I'm writing
"
human,"<start>  for various magazines and preparing a book proposal. 
"
human,"<start>  I dropped out rather early. I must say, I do admire anyone
"
human,"<start>  who has the kind of discipline you obviously have. 
"
human,"<start>  I thnk I have visited a few high-pressure schools. However,
"
human,"<start>  when you're a visitor you don't feel any of the stuff you
"
human,"<start>  describe -- unless you are receptive to it. I have never
"
human,"<start>  visited Yale but I've been around the Columbia campus and
"
human,"<start>  also the campus of a well-known joint out west and, well,
"
human,"<start>  none of the other universities I have visited were probably
"
human,"<start>  high pressure establishments. NYU?
"
human,"<start>  I gave a little talk at the NYU drama school a few years
"
human,"<start>  ago. Between you and me, I'm very dubious of all these institutions.
"
human,"<start>  They're like gigantic bureacracies as far as I can see.
"
human,"<start>  listen, er, woukld you think it's rude if we move on to
"
human,"<start>  the next person? It's nothing personal but you'll undresrtand
"
human,"<start>  later....
"
human,"<start>  okay thanks, I really appreciate it. I'll be nice to you
"
human,"<start>  later. Promise. Bye.
"
human,"<start>  hello?
"
human,"<start>  apparnelty I'm not allowed to do this, we have to keep chatting,.
"
human,"<start>  i'll be right back?
"
human,"<start>  well that was a short break.
"
human,"<start>  But isn't life more fun this way?
"
human,"<start>  Well a little spontaneity and confusion often makes things
"
human,"<start>  more interesting.
"
human,"<start>  I went, couldn't you tell?
"
human,"<start>  Computers do core dumps quicker than most.
"
human,"<start>  Yes but then having to clean up the hard drive is a mess.
"
human,"<start>  Ah for a good programming environment and operating system
"
human,"<start>  that keeps up with and makes allowances for human error.
"
human,"<start>  seen,.  Although they're getting better.  It's amazing that
"
human,"<start>  Well wait a year and a half for the new Mac operating system.
"
human,"<start>  But playing with OS/2 the last day and a half has been a
"
human,"<start>  hell of a lot more fun than dealing with DOS.  Please, stop
"
human,"<start>  me before I DOS again. .....aaaaiiiggggghhh.
"
human,"<start>  let's change the subject, my dear. How many years did you
"
human,"<start>  say you have left in the clinker?
"
human,"<start>  byeee
"
human,"<start>  hello there.
"
human,"<start>  well, I think I can handle myself if that should arise.
"
human,"<start>  And you?
"
human,"<start>  very funny. You shall start -- why don't yuo lead, as it
"
human,"<start>  were?
"
human,"<start>  new to discuss.
"
human,"<start>  Everybody talks about the weather. It's amazing. Also, the
"
human,"<start>  movies. And education. But that doesn't mean we can't discuss
"
human,"<start>  those things if you have some compelling urge to do so.
"
human,"<start>  chit chat--you seem much more serious. What do you know about
"
human,"<start>  I am not at liberty to discuss that. What's your name?
"
human,"<start>  Passive agressive, I see. 
"
human,"<start>  It's all in your mind. What's the story with that?
"
human,"<start>  , but how large is your cache of jokes?
"
human,"<start>  I used to know a few really tasteless ones but I haven't
"
human,"<start>  been very dutiful about collecting them latrely. I undersrtabnd
"
human,"<start>  Thadd is a great punmesister.
"
human,"<start>  Keybard! I love it. Very cute. 
"
human,"<start>  Last week? Smething like that. 
"
human,"<start>  Hm. It was about one of his characters, not about him. 
"
human,"<start>  Why do you want to know?
"
human,"<start>  I have my own keyboard, thank you. You're talking to one
"
human,"<start>  of the least eager consumers ever. I am an extremely unwilling
"
human,"<start>  customer.
"
human,"<start>  trivial--that seems to be popular with your colleagues.
"
human,"<start>  No! I'm not intersted in Science Fiction or any of thatr
"
human,"<start>  stuff, at all. I understand Fred is a Star Trek nut.
"
human,"<start>  Hugh is one of my internet friends, We are on a few discussion
"
human,"<start>  groups and sometimes we run ideas by each other. He's quite
"
human,"<start>  the fellow, isn't he?
"
human,"<start>  Same sas yours isn't it? A PC. As you probably know, our
"
human,"<start>  conversation is going to be permanently available to the
"
human,"<start>  public and that would actually include Hugh, so your sales
"
human,"<start>  pitch won't have to be repeated twice.
"
human,"<start>  between keyboarding and replies. Also could you a backspace
"
human,"<start>  oh. bye!
