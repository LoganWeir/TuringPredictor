human,<start>  hello? <end>,1
human,<start>  well? <end>,1
human,<start>  no doubt you say that to all the girls. <end>,9
human,<start>  i understand. how long have you felt this way?? <end>,9
human,<start>  all right. let's clean it up. how's the weather? <end>,9
human,<start>  actually i thought the air this morning was extremely refreshing. <end>,10
human,<start>  aha. <end>,1
human,<start>  no i meant... never mind. In this town. The center of the <end>,12
human,<start>  weather universe. <end>,2
human,<start>  New York? <end>,2
human,<start>  Where are you from? <end>,4
human,<start>  Er. India? <end>,2
human,<start>  May I ask you a question? <end>,6
human,<start>  How long have you lived away from bombay? <end>,8
human,<start>  Is it rude to ask a person from your country what caste <end>,12
human,<start>  their family is from? <end>,4
human,<start>  How so? <end>,2
human,"<start>  I see. ""Tolerant of this question."" Meaning what? Is it <end>",10
human,<start>  considered to be a stupid tourist type question? So to speak... <end>,11
human,<start>  Huh? The vietnam War is Over! <end>,6
human,<start>  Is this a trick question? :) <end>,6
human,<start>  But it's hardly the first time this has happened. Just another <end>,11
human,"<start>  Crusade(s) of another kind... As a younger person, I was <end>",10
human,<start>  opposed to the war because everyone in my environment was. <end>,10
human,<start>  I cannot really think about Vietnam clearly -- it's completely <end>,10
human,<start>  tied up with my childhood memories. <end>,6
human,<start>  I understand. [Did you know the granite for the 'nam memorial <end>,11
human,<start>  Wow. That's hard to answer. Let me think. For no reason <end>,11
human,"<start>  to do with her acting, Clara Bow. I like what she represented, <end>",12
human,<start>  but I don't know if I've ever seen a Clara Bow movie. I'm <end>,13
human,<start>  drawing a blank on actresses for some off reason. <end>,9
human,"<start>  I meant ODD reason. I believe Clara Bow is dead, so she <end>",12
human,<start>  doesn't look like much of anything -- now. <end>,8
human,<start>  Are you saying all these pink nudes on the walls of this <end>,12
human,<start>  room with grape-tits and frizzly hair all look the same??? <end>,10
human,"<start>  I haven't seen that yet. As a matter of fact, I have enjoyed <end>",13
human,"<start>  the Italian movies I've seen. Many years ago, I saw a hilarious <end>",12
human,"<start>  little number called ""I Hate Blondes"" about a man plagued <end>",10
human,<start>  by desire for a cartoonlike blonde streetwalker. It was <end>,9
human,<start>  very sweet. American cinema is often too serious on some <end>,10
human,<start>  level for me. Or tries to be serious. I think you know what <end>,13
human,<start>  I mean. <end>,2
human,<start>  are you a cmputer or a person? <end>,7
human,<start>  When does middle age begin? I'm still passing for 20s. <end>,10
human,"<start>  Not 20, but 20s. <end>",4
human,<start>  hello! <end>,1
human,"<start>  Very original. The weather, I mean. It has never done thus <end>",11
human,<start>  - this-- before. <end>,3
human,<start>  Actually seems to be in a resting mode. This is a classic <end>,12
human,<start>  April day. <end>,2
human,<start>  Um. I believe it's April. <end>,5
human,<start>  That's a very good question. Because months and days and <end>,10
human,<start>  so on are arbitrary -- I suppose. <end>,7
human,<start>  Really? You are somewhat reticent yourself. <end>,6
human,<start>  I know. <end>,2
human,<start>  Moi*? <end>,1
human,"<start>  And you? The strange thing is, there is an inescapable tendency <end>",11
human,<start>  to try to imitate the doings of a machine. I wonder why. <end>,12
human,<start>  Hm. If you're so smart can't you tell? <end>,8
human,<start>  Come on. Am I a male or a female?? <end>,9
human,<start>  What's repressed about me? <end>,4
human,<start>  Not a chance. Anybody who is not repressed is in pretty <end>,11
human,<start>  sad shape. <end>,2
human,"<start>  Because that is what civilization's all about. I mean, inorder <end>",10
human,"<start>  to win friends, influence people and just basically live <end>",9
human,<start>  amongst others one must repress some desires and drives. <end>,9
human,<start>  No? <end>,1
human,<start>  Completely self-educated. <end>,2
human,<start>  I'm not sure I would put it that way. I rejected formal <end>,12
human,<start>  education at an early age. <end>,5
human,<start>  Oy. I'm so flattered. <end>,4
human,<start>  Hm. This conversation is public isn't it? I believe all <end>,10
human,<start>  our interactions (during the contest) are available to the <end>,9
human,<start>  public. <end>,1
human,<start>  I don't think so. I'm extremely -- er-- I'm a clean freak. <end>,12
human,<start>  Conversations like this make me very uptight. <end>,7
human,<start>  Oh please. I haven't the foggiest about that. I'm too much <end>,11
human,<start>  of a girl for that kind of thing. <end>,8
human,<start>  Any particular director? <end>,3
human,<start>  Yes? I never got around to that one. I ought to see it. <end>,13
human,<start>  Is it as scary today as it was reputed to be when it came <end>,14
human,<start>  out? Or does it seem corny? <end>,6
human,<start>  I think I've seen ONE. But I can't recall. Hang on -- who <end>,13
human,"<start>  did that crazy flick starring Mary Shelley? I mean, it was <end>",11
human,<start>  about Mary Shelley -- Gothic? That was Ken.... <end>,8
human,"<start>  No, I don't think so. Someone with an older reputation. <end>",10
human,<start>  OK< it wasn't Kubrick... Name a few Kurbick movies. Maybe <end>,10
human,<start>  I;ve seen one. <end>,3
human,<start>  Fine. <end>,1
human,"<start>  Oh, the Shining. That was Kubrick? I saw rthat. Oops. <end>",10
human,<start>  I imagine so. It somehow doesn't seem like it would be one <end>,12
human,<start>  of his most interesting. I found it stimulating but nothing <end>,10
human,"<start>  amazingly brilliant, surely. I am not a big horror fan. <end>",10
human,<start>  Terrified out of my mind. But so what? That in itseklf is <end>,12
human,<start>  not a fascinating experience. I'm terrified every time I <end>,9
human,"<start>  try to cross the street -- well, not quite. But you get <end>",12
human,<start>  the idea. <end>,2
human,"<start>  Charmed, I'm sure. <end>",3
human,"<start>  Hello, Judge #3. How are you? <end>",6
human,<start>  Are they here with you today? I don't understand. <end>,9
human,"<start>  Oh, I never did underastand that particular refernece. I've <end>",9
human,<start>  seen it in Wired and in various pop culture places. What <end>,11
human,<start>  the hell does it mean? Ones and Zeros. <end>,8
human,<start>  Sheesh. Guess I'm still on. <end>,5
human,<start>  How do you know I don't want my oicture taken? <end>,10
human,<start>  ARe you someone I've met? <end>,5
human,"<start>  It's not a job, my dear. It's an ... adventure of sorts. <end>",12
human,<start>  Hugh is a pal of mine. We met on the 'net and for some reason <end>,15
human,"<start>  he thinks I'm an excellent example of... humanity? HUmanness, <end>",9
human,<start>  I guess. <end>,2
human,"<start>  No, I wouldn't go that far. <end>",6
human,<start>  Bots? <end>,1
human,<start>  So tell me about the Star Trek thing. I've never really <end>,11
human,"<start>  ""gotten"" that show. But those who do seem to watch nothing <end>",11
human,<start>  else. <end>,1
human,"<start>  Hm. Oh, I think I understand. Do the programs have names? <end>",11
human,<start>  TQ <end>,1
human,"<start>  Yes, I do. And you? <end>",5
human,<start>  A lot of techies seem to live in Brooklyn. <end>,9
human,<start>  Where the hell are you *from*? <end>,6
human,<start>  I see. What part of Brooklyn are you in and do you like <end>,13
human,<start>  it? <end>,1
human,<start>  I'm sorry but you can't withdraw that question. I saw it! <end>,11
human,<start>  I am probably too staid for your band. <end>,8
human,<start>  I have enjoyed some of Hank Williams and that sort of thing <end>,12
human,<start>  but my favorite kind of music to listen to live is Eartha <end>,12
human,"<start>  Kitt, Peggy Lee, obby Short, that kind of thing. I also <end>",11
human,<start>  like the Blues. <end>,3
human,<start>  Yanni? That endless din -- I heard it when I was in Greece. <end>,13
human,<start>  He's like a national folk hero for the young set. I can't <end>,12
human,<start>  stand it. It's like New Age music. <end>,7
human,<start>  I havenm't seen andrea marcovicci but i suspect I would <end>,10
human,<start>  like her. <end>,2
human,<start>  How sweet. That's the first time I've ever heard that. (eyelash <end>,11
human,<start>  fluttering) <end>,1
human,"<start>  You know, if there's one thing I can't stand it's these <end>",11
human,"<start>  peolpe who send out endless e-mail, screens long, filled <end>",9
human,<start>  with sloppy typos and spelling errors. I am on a few list <end>,12
human,<start>  serve discussion groups and I cannot believe the stuff I've <end>,10
human,"<start>  seen. Graphic types don't care about punctuation, etc. They <end>",9
human,<start>  probably figure that if the machine is willing to send the <end>,11
human,"<start>  thing, it must be okay. <end>",5
human,<start>  No way! <end>,2
human,"<start>  There are more tactful ways to chat a girl up, you know. <end>",12
human,<start>  I don't know what your success rate is but you're either <end>,11
human,<start>  very lucky or oblivious... :) <end>,5
human,<start>  Is that some sort of innuendo? <end>,6
human,"<start>  As to the Star Lady reference, let me explain. Women never <end>",11
human,<start>  like to think that they've confused with some other female <end>,10
human,<start>  in a guy's mind. It is just one of those things. <end>,11
human,"<start>  Identity crisis time. Well, so tell me, what goes on in <end>",11
human,<start>  the aforementioned chat room at AOL? <end>,6
human,<start>  Don;t count on it. There's a shoe for every foot. I am not <end>,13
human,<start>  a big AOL fan. It's like the shopping mall arcade of th4e <end>,12
human,"<start>  internet, isn't it?? <end>",3
human,<start>  I beg your pardon? <end>,4
human,<start>  I thought I already spoke to Judge #2? <end>,8
human,<start>  REally?? But you're the 4th. <end>,5
human,<start>  I'll take your word for it. What else have you to say for <end>,13
human,<start>  yuorself today? <end>,2
human,<start>  Speed isn't everything. How often do you visit New York? <end>,10
human,"<start>  But now you're at Yale, aren'ty you> <end>",7
human,"<start>  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Where did you live when you <end>",12
human,<start>  were growing up here? <end>,4
human,"<start>  Not really. But yes, in other ways. <end>",7
human,<start>  I moved here when I was a very young adult. So I did grow <end>,14
human,"<start>  up here in many ways. I was not, howeverm born in the city, <end>",13
human,<start>  or anywhere very near to it. <end>,6
human,<start>  No. I'm a non-academic. <end>,4
human,<start>  Writing and experimenting. <end>,3
human,"<start>  No No, I'm not especially computer-literate. I'm writing <end>",8
human,<start>  for various magazines and preparing a book proposal. <end>,8
human,"<start>  I dropped out rather early. I must say, I do admire anyone <end>",12
human,<start>  who has the kind of discipline you obviously have. <end>,9
human,"<start>  I thnk I have visited a few high-pressure schools. However, <end>",10
human,<start>  when you're a visitor you don't feel any of the stuff you <end>,12
human,<start>  describe -- unless you are receptive to it. I have never <end>,11
human,<start>  visited Yale but I've been around the Columbia campus and <end>,10
human,"<start>  also the campus of a well-known joint out west and, well, <end>",11
human,<start>  none of the other universities I have visited were probably <end>,10
human,<start>  high pressure establishments. NYU? <end>,4
human,<start>  I gave a little talk at the NYU drama school a few years <end>,13
human,"<start>  ago. Between you and me, I'm very dubious of all these institutions. <end>",12
human,<start>  They're like gigantic bureacracies as far as I can see. <end>,10
human,"<start>  listen, er, woukld you think it's rude if we move on to <end>",12
human,<start>  the next person? It's nothing personal but you'll undresrtand <end>,9
human,<start>  later.... <end>,1
human,"<start>  okay thanks, I really appreciate it. I'll be nice to you <end>",11
human,<start>  later. Promise. Bye. <end>,3
human,<start>  hello? <end>,1
human,"<start>  apparnelty I'm not allowed to do this, we have to keep chatting,. <end>",12
human,<start>  i'll be right back? <end>,4
human,<start>  well that was a short break. <end>,6
human,<start>  But isn't life more fun this way? <end>,7
human,<start>  Well a little spontaneity and confusion often makes things <end>,9
human,<start>  more interesting. <end>,2
human,"<start>  I went, couldn't you tell? <end>",5
human,<start>  Computers do core dumps quicker than most. <end>,7
human,<start>  Yes but then having to clean up the hard drive is a mess. <end>,13
human,<start>  Ah for a good programming environment and operating system <end>,9
human,<start>  that keeps up with and makes allowances for human error. <end>,10
human,"<start>  seen,.  Although they're getting better.  It's amazing that <end>",8
human,<start>  Well wait a year and a half for the new Mac operating system. <end>,13
human,<start>  But playing with OS/2 the last day and a half has been a <end>,13
human,"<start>  hell of a lot more fun than dealing with DOS.  Please, stop <end>",12
human,<start>  me before I DOS again. .....aaaaiiiggggghhh. <end>,6
human,"<start>  let's change the subject, my dear. How many years did you <end>",11
human,<start>  say you have left in the clinker? <end>,7
human,<start>  byeee <end>,1
human,<start>  hello there. <end>,2
human,"<start>  well, I think I can handle myself if that should arise. <end>",11
human,<start>  And you? <end>,2
human,"<start>  very funny. You shall start -- why don't yuo lead, as it <end>",12
human,<start>  were? <end>,1
human,<start>  new to discuss. <end>,3
human,"<start>  Everybody talks about the weather. It's amazing. Also, the <end>",9
human,<start>  movies. And education. But that doesn't mean we can't discuss <end>,10
human,<start>  those things if you have some compelling urge to do so. <end>,11
human,<start>  chit chat--you seem much more serious. What do you know about <end>,11
human,<start>  I am not at liberty to discuss that. What's your name? <end>,11
human,"<start>  Passive agressive, I see. <end>",4
human,<start>  It's all in your mind. What's the story with that? <end>,10
human,"<start>  , but how large is your cache of jokes? <end>",9
human,<start>  I used to know a few really tasteless ones but I haven't <end>,12
human,<start>  been very dutiful about collecting them latrely. I undersrtabnd <end>,9
human,<start>  Thadd is a great punmesister. <end>,5
human,<start>  Keybard! I love it. Very cute. <end>,6
human,<start>  Last week? Smething like that. <end>,5
human,"<start>  Hm. It was about one of his characters, not about him. <end>",11
human,<start>  Why do you want to know? <end>,6
human,"<start>  I have my own keyboard, thank you. You're talking to one <end>",11
human,<start>  of the least eager consumers ever. I am an extremely unwilling <end>,11
human,<start>  customer. <end>,1
human,<start>  trivial--that seems to be popular with your colleagues. <end>,8
human,<start>  No! I'm not intersted in Science Fiction or any of thatr <end>,11
human,"<start>  stuff, at all. I understand Fred is a Star Trek nut. <end>",11
human,"<start>  Hugh is one of my internet friends, We are on a few discussion <end>",13
human,<start>  groups and sometimes we run ideas by each other. He's quite <end>,11
human,"<start>  the fellow, isn't he? <end>",4
human,"<start>  Same sas yours isn't it? A PC. As you probably know, our <end>",12
human,<start>  conversation is going to be permanently available to the <end>,9
human,"<start>  public and that would actually include Hugh, so your sales <end>",10
human,<start>  pitch won't have to be repeated twice. <end>,7
human,<start>  between keyboarding and replies. Also could you a backspace <end>,9
human,<start>  oh. bye! <end>,2
program,<start> How about telling me a joke? <end>,6
program,<start> Here's my favorite joke...  A dog limps into a bar with a bloody <end>,13
program,"<start> bandage on his foot.  He's wearing a 10-gallon hat, six-shooters in <end>",11
program,"<start> his holsters and chaps.  He growled, ""I'm a-lookin' for the man that <end>",12
