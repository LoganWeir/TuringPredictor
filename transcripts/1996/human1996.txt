START AT 1996/03/16  10:24:05
CONFEDR[10:24:23] hello?
JUDGE05[10:24:37] hi there, my name  is chan
CONFEDR[10:24:47] well? 
JUDGE05[10:25:13] i am a wizard, I massage programs into marvellous sentient
JUDGE05[10:25:15] beings.
CONFEDR[10:25:26] no doubt you say that to all the girls. 
JUDGE05[10:25:46] and to guys too. actually i am a girl, so i prefer saying
JUDGE05[10:25:49] it to girls.
JUDGE05[10:25:58] oops, i meant guys.
CONFEDR[10:26:09] i understand. how long have you felt this way??
JUDGE05[10:26:19] felt who? i dont go around feeling people.
CONFEDR[10:26:33] all right. let's clean it up. how's the weather?
JUDGE05[10:26:48] it sucks. supposed to be april and it's wet and steamy,
JUDGE05[10:26:55] like a torrid love affair.
CONFEDR[10:27:13] actually i thought the air this morning was extremely refreshing.
JUDGE05[10:27:19] in which town, pray?
CONFEDR[10:27:25] aha.
JUDGE05[10:27:32] where is aha?
CONFEDR[10:28:02] no i meant... never mind. In this town. The center of the
CONFEDR[10:28:05] weather universe.
JUDGE05[10:28:17] I get the feeling you are evading my question. could you
JUDGE05[10:28:24] name the town where the air is refreshing?
CONFEDR[10:28:30] New York?
JUDGE05[10:28:33] Yahoooooooooooooo!!
CONFEDR[10:28:44] Where are you from?
JUDGE05[10:28:53] Bombay. Know where that is?
CONFEDR[10:28:59] Er. India?
JUDGE05[10:29:13] Right on. There are also Bombay's in this town, all over.
CONFEDR[10:29:22] May I ask you a question?
JUDGE05[10:29:32] Go right ahead, my dearest 'un.
CONFEDR[10:29:48] How long have you lived away from bombay?
JUDGE05[10:30:03] 8 months now. But I come here often.... it's like home for
JUDGE05[10:30:08] me here now. 
CONFEDR[10:30:29] Is it rude to ask a person from your country what caste
CONFEDR[10:30:37] their family is from?
JUDGE05[10:30:56] In general yes. But my generation is different -- we are
JUDGE05[10:30:57] more
JUDGE05[10:31:06] likely to be tolerant of this question. I was talking to
JUDGE05[10:31:20] a sociologist the other day, and we were discussing how
JUDGE05[10:31:33] some things about India are like societal norms of
JUDGE05[10:31:45] the Amerrican midwest 20 years ago....
CONFEDR[10:31:49] How so?
JUDGE05[10:32:11] The same suspicion of anything different. The same red-neckness
JUDGE05[10:32:18] in a different guise.
CONFEDR[10:32:34] I see. "Tolerant of this question." Meaning what? Is it
CONFEDR[10:32:47] considered to be a stupid tourist type question? So to speak...
JUDGE05[10:33:09] Sort of. My generation (I am getting to middle-age!) would
JUDGE05[10:33:21] not worry about the caste of their neighbour. Earlier times
JUDGE05[10:33:25] this wasnt true.
JUDGE05[10:33:42] What do you think of America's role in 'nam?
CONFEDR[10:33:53] Huh? The vietnam War is Over!
JUDGE05[10:34:07] No, what I meant was: do you think the US should have got
JUDGE05[10:34:12] involved?
CONFEDR[10:34:20] Is this a trick question? :)
JUDGE05[10:34:28] All questions are trick questiopns!!
JUDGE05[10:34:44] BTW, when I went to the Vietnam war memorial in DC, I cried.
JUDGE05[10:35:03] Not so much for the people who dies (that is *sad*, surely)
JUDGE05[10:35:25] [I meant died, not dies], but more for the government's\
JUDGE05[10:35:37] stupidity, so to say, in sending them to die.
CONFEDR[10:35:51] But it's hardly the first time this has happened. Just another
CONFEDR[10:36:07] Crusade(s) of another kind... As a younger person, I was
CONFEDR[10:36:28] opposed to the war because everyone in my environment was.
CONFEDR[10:36:51] I cannot really think about Vietnam clearly -- it's completely
CONFEDR[10:37:00] tied up with my childhood memories. 
CONFEDR[10:37:24] I understand. [Did you know the granite for the 'nam memorial
JUDGE05[10:37:38] came from Bangalore, India. Strange connection between us.]
JUDGE05[10:37:50] Let's change the topic. Who is your favourite actress?
CONFEDR[10:38:13] Wow. That's hard to answer. Let me think. For no reason
CONFEDR[10:38:29] to do with her acting, Clara Bow. I like what she represented,
CONFEDR[10:38:49] but I don't know if I've ever seen a Clara Bow movie. I'm
CONFEDR[10:38:57] drawing a blank on actresses for some off reason.
JUDGE05[10:39:11] Does Clara Bow look like one of these pink nudes on the
JUDGE05[10:39:32] walls of this room with grape-tits and frizzly hair all
JUDGE05[10:39:34] over?
CONFEDR[10:39:52] I meant ODD reason. I believe Clara Bow is dead, so she
CONFEDR[10:39:59] doesn't look like much of anything -- now.
JUDGE05[10:40:12] But when she was alive and kicking, was she like this?
CONFEDR[10:40:25] Are you saying all these pink nudes on the walls of this
CONFEDR[10:40:35] room with grape-tits and frizzly hair all look the same???
JUDGE05[10:40:56] There's a theme running across. Grotesqueness, accentuated
JUDGE05[10:40:59] features.
JUDGE05[10:41:17] Do you like Italian films? I saw "The Postman" recently.
CONFEDR[10:41:32] I haven't seen that yet. As a matter of fact, I have enjoyed
CONFEDR[10:41:45] the Italian movies I've seen. Many years ago, I saw a hilarious
CONFEDR[10:41:54] little number called "I Hate Blondes" about a man plagued
CONFEDR[10:42:04] by desire for a cartoonlike blonde streetwalker. It was
CONFEDR[10:42:16] very sweet. American cinema is often too serious on some
CONFEDR[10:42:25] level for me. Or tries to be serious. I think you know what
CONFEDR[10:42:27] I mean.
JUDGE05[10:42:38] They say we have to move on soon, so let me try and sum,
JUDGE05[10:42:57] up -- you are a cultured, knowledgable middle-aged person,
JUDGE05[10:43:16] who likes film, and [hey are you male or female? not that
JUDGE05[10:43:30] it matters, but curious.] good to talk to.
JUDGE05[10:43:36] what do you think of me?
CONFEDR[10:43:44] are you a cmputer or a person? 
JUDGE05[10:43:56] ha ha !! I'd love to, but i have nothing to wear, one
JUDGE05[10:44:01] of the nudes here says.
CONFEDR[10:44:19] When does middle age begin? I'm still passing for 20s.
CONFEDR[10:44:24] Not 20, but 20s.

*** JUDGE04 ***
START AT 1996/03/16  10:44:44
CONFEDR[10:44:55] hello!
JUDGE04[10:45:01] How's the weather?
CONFEDR[10:45:19] Very original. The weather, I mean. It has never done thus
CONFEDR[10:45:27] - this-- before.
JUDGE04[10:45:42] What is it doing?
CONFEDR[10:46:08] Actually seems to be in a resting mode. This is a classic
CONFEDR[10:46:12] April day.
JUDGE04[10:46:21] Is it April or May?
CONFEDR[10:46:31] Um. I believe it's April.
JUDGE04[10:46:50] Why do you say that?
CONFEDR[10:47:10] That's a very good question. Because months and days and
CONFEDR[10:47:21] so on are arbitrary -- I suppose. 
JUDGE04[10:47:52] It seems you are taking a certain tone with me. An agitated,
JUDGE04[10:47:59] human tone...
CONFEDR[10:48:16] Really? You are somewhat reticent yourself.
JUDGE04[10:48:32] I never said you were reticent.
CONFEDR[10:48:36] I know.
JUDGE04[10:48:42] Smug.
CONFEDR[10:48:49] Moi*?
JUDGE04[10:49:00] I think you might be human.
CONFEDR[10:49:25] And you? The strange thing is, there is an inescapable tendency
CONFEDR[10:49:48] to try to imitate the doings of a machine. I wonder why.
JUDGE04[10:50:09] You can't fool me. Male or female?
CONFEDR[10:50:23] Hm. If you're so smart can't you tell?
JUDGE04[10:50:43] Actually, now I'm on the fence.
CONFEDR[10:50:53] Come on. Am I a male or a female??
JUDGE04[10:51:07] Repressed female.
CONFEDR[10:51:16] What's repressed about me?
JUDGE04[10:51:36] I don't know. Just thought I could get under your skin.
CONFEDR[10:51:50] Not a chance. Anybody who is not repressed is in pretty
CONFEDR[10:51:53] sad shape.
JUDGE04[10:51:57] Why?
CONFEDR[10:52:17] Because that is what civilization's all about. I mean, inorder
CONFEDR[10:52:27] to win friends, influence people and just basically live
CONFEDR[10:52:38] amongst others one must repress some desires and drives.
CONFEDR[10:52:40] No?
JUDGE04[10:53:03] You're fairly intelligent. What kind of education do you
JUDGE04[10:53:06] have?
CONFEDR[10:53:11] Completely self-educated.
JUDGE04[10:53:27] Well read, you mean?
CONFEDR[10:53:55] I'm not sure I would put it that way. I rejected formal
CONFEDR[10:54:01] education at an early age. 
JUDGE04[10:54:35] So, you're a street-wise *person*. Or rather, your programmer
JUDGE04[10:54:44] is a street wise person?
CONFEDR[10:54:50] Oy. I'm so flattered.
JUDGE04[10:55:18] I'd like to get together with you after the contest. Have
JUDGE04[10:55:26] some drinks. Shoot the shit.
CONFEDR[10:55:41] Hm. This conversation is public isn't it? I believe all
CONFEDR[10:55:54] our interactions (during the contest) are available to the
CONFEDR[10:55:59] public. 
JUDGE04[10:56:16] God you are so human I can almost smell you.
CONFEDR[10:56:40] I don't think so. I'm extremely -- er-- I'm a clean freak.
CONFEDR[10:56:46] Conversations like this make me very uptight.
JUDGE04[10:57:08] I'm sorry. Let's change topics. How about Heavy metal music?
CONFEDR[10:57:19] Oh please. I haven't the foggiest about that. I'm too much
CONFEDR[10:57:23] of a girl for that kind of thing.
JUDGE04[10:57:33] OK. How about movies?
CONFEDR[10:57:48] Any particular director?
JUDGE04[10:58:21] Kubrick. I just rented A clockwork Orange last night.
CONFEDR[10:58:31] Yes? I never got around to that one. I ought to see it.
CONFEDR[10:58:44] Is it as scary today as it was reputed to be when it came
CONFEDR[10:58:50] out? Or does it seem corny?
JUDGE04[10:59:30] Yea. It's pretty scarey. It's a satire really.  What Kubrick
JUDGE04[10:59:36] movies have you seen?
CONFEDR[10:59:47] I think I've seen ONE. But I can't recall. Hang on -- who
CONFEDR[11:00:06] did that crazy flick starring Mary Shelley? I mean, it was
CONFEDR[11:00:18] about Mary Shelley -- Gothic? That was Ken....
JUDGE04[11:00:46] Branaugh? (sp)
CONFEDR[11:01:03] No, I don't think so. Someone with an older reputation.
CONFEDR[11:01:13] OK< it wasn't Kubrick... Name a few Kurbick movies. Maybe
CONFEDR[11:01:16] I;ve seen one.
JUDGE04[11:01:39] Please don't correct your typing; I know what you mean.
JUDGE04[11:01:47] Slows the conversation down...
CONFEDR[11:01:52] Fine. 
JUDGE04[11:02:37] Kubrick: Lolita. 2001: A space Odessey; Full Metal Jacket;
JUDGE04[11:02:47] The Shining...
CONFEDR[11:03:02] Oh, the Shining. That was Kubrick? I saw rthat. Oops.
JUDGE04[11:03:21] Everyone knows that one...
CONFEDR[11:03:35] I imagine so. It somehow doesn't seem like it would be one
CONFEDR[11:03:47] of his most interesting. I found it stimulating but nothing
CONFEDR[11:04:01] amazingly brilliant, surely. I am not a big horror fan.
JUDGE04[11:04:09] You weren't scared?
CONFEDR[11:04:22] Terrified out of my mind. But so what? That in itseklf is
CONFEDR[11:04:31] not a fascinating experience. I'm terrified every time I
CONFEDR[11:04:41] try to cross the street -- well, not quite. But you get
CONFEDR[11:04:43] the idea.
JUDGE04[11:04:53] Bye, I'll meet you later

CONFEDR[11:05:33] Hello, Judge #3. How are you?
JUDGE03[11:05:47] well, i've just had a conversation with a guy named fred
JUDGE03[11:05:56] who only watches star trek and another named thad who tells
JUDGE03[11:06:07] really bad jokes.  other than that, i'm fine.  you?
CONFEDR[11:06:15] Are they here with you today? I don't understand.
JUDGE03[11:06:39] they seem to be a bunch of zeros (and ones, i guess).
CONFEDR[11:06:57] Oh, I never did underastand that particular refernece. I've
CONFEDR[11:07:11] seen it in Wired and in various pop culture places. What
CONFEDR[11:07:17] the hell does it mean? Ones and Zeros.
JUDGE03[11:07:33] it refers to the fact that computers run on binary code
JUDGE03[11:07:46] -- one means on and zero means off, whichf is how they work.
JUDGE03[11:07:54]  are you on or off today?
CONFEDR[11:08:02] Sheesh. Guess I'm still on.
JUDGE03[11:08:10] why don't you want your picture taken?
CONFEDR[11:08:19] How do you know I don't want my oicture taken?
JUDGE03[11:08:31] because you said so.  at least i think you did.  am i crossing
JUDGE03[11:08:33] the line here?
CONFEDR[11:08:43] ARe you someone I've met?
JUDGE03[11:08:54] not really.  how did you get this job?
CONFEDR[11:09:12] It's not a job, my dear. It's an ... adventure of sorts.
JUDGE03[11:09:18] me too.
CONFEDR[11:09:29] Hugh is a pal of mine. We met on the 'net and for some reason
CONFEDR[11:09:44] he thinks I'm an excellent example of... humanity? HUmanness,
CONFEDR[11:09:45] I guess.
JUDGE03[11:09:54] hughmanness perhaps.
CONFEDR[11:10:02] No, I wouldn't go that far. 
JUDGE03[11:10:16] i'm a writer and i just got fasctinated with the idea of
JUDGE03[11:10:24] chats and bots and stuff, so i contacted him and here i
JUDGE03[11:10:41] am having at long last a conversation.
CONFEDR[11:10:48] Bots?
JUDGE03[11:11:02] robots on the net such as these to my right are called 'bots.
CONFEDR[11:11:14] So tell me about the Star Trek thing. I've never really
CONFEDR[11:11:25] "gotten" that show. But those who do seem to watch nothing
CONFEDR[11:11:27] else.
JUDGE03[11:11:40] well, i liked it when i was a kid but i don't watch much
JUDGE03[11:11:52] TV anymore.  i have to say that a program that is expert
JUDGE03[11:12:03] in star trek is sort of a quick giveaway.  
CONFEDR[11:12:26] Hm. Oh, I think I understand. Do the programs have names?
JUDGE03[11:12:37] yes.  trekkie over there is called fred, and the borscht
JUDGE03[11:12:46] belt comedian is called thaddeus and the other one i never
JUDGE03[11:12:58] got.  do you have a name that you can divulge?
CONFEDR[11:13:00] TQ
JUDGE03[11:13:10] do you live in new york, tq?
CONFEDR[11:13:18] Yes, I do. And you?
JUDGE03[11:13:29] yes.  i reside in brooklyn but work downtown here in this
JUDGE03[11:13:30] island.
CONFEDR[11:13:40] A lot of techies seem to live in Brooklyn.
JUDGE03[11:13:53] really?  that surprises me.  i think of brooklyn as being
JUDGE03[11:13:58] mobsters.
CONFEDR[11:14:07] Where the hell are you *from*?
JUDGE03[11:14:20] originally the midwest but i've been living out here for
JUDGE03[11:14:23] about 8 years.
CONFEDR[11:14:31] I see. What part of Brooklyn are you in and do you like
CONFEDR[11:14:33] it?
JUDGE03[11:14:41] i live in williamsburg, it's the north part, and i love
JUDGE03[11:14:50] it because it's like a small comunity and i have a lot of
JUDGE03[11:15:13] friends there.  what kind of music do you like (if you do)?
CONFEDR[11:15:22] I'm sorry but you can't withdraw that question. I saw it!
CONFEDR[11:15:31] I am probably too staid for your band.
JUDGE03[11:15:55] you're tricky.  no, our band is sort of country-ish sort
JUDGE03[11:16:09] of blue-grassy sometimes.  we're pretty traditional.
CONFEDR[11:16:20] I have enjoyed some of Hank Williams and that sort of thing
CONFEDR[11:16:32] but my favorite kind of music to listen to live is Eartha
CONFEDR[11:16:49] Kitt, Peggy Lee, obby Short, that kind of thing. I also
CONFEDR[11:16:57] like the Blues. 
JUDGE03[11:17:12] i used to live in chicago, so blues is good.  andrea marcovicci?
JUDGE03[11:17:25] what about yanni live at carnegie hall?
CONFEDR[11:17:36] Yanni? That endless din -- I heard it when I was in Greece.
CONFEDR[11:17:45] He's like a national folk hero for the young set. I can't
CONFEDR[11:17:51] stand it. It's like New Age music.
JUDGE03[11:18:02] i've never heard the guy i jsut like to make fun of him.
JUDGE03[11:18:11]  cheap shot i know.  
CONFEDR[11:18:30] I havenm't seen andrea marcovicci but i suspect I would
CONFEDR[11:18:32] like her. 
JUDGE03[11:18:45] yeah, i've always wantedt to go.  hey, you don't have to
JUDGE03[11:18:52] correct your typing with me.  
CONFEDR[11:19:04] How sweet. That's the first time I've ever heard that. (eyelash
CONFEDR[11:19:08] fluttering)
JUDGE03[11:19:25] it's just that well i don't care much about spelling i guess.
JUDGE03[11:19:31]  there are more important things in life.
CONFEDR[11:19:39] You know, if there's one thing I can't stand it's these
CONFEDR[11:19:48] peolpe who send out endless e-mail, screens long, filled
CONFEDR[11:19:57] with sloppy typos and spelling errors. I am on a few list
CONFEDR[11:20:09] serve discussion groups and I cannot believe the stuff I've
CONFEDR[11:20:23] seen. Graphic types don't care about punctuation, etc. They
CONFEDR[11:20:31] probably figure that if the machine is willing to send the
CONFEDR[11:20:35] thing, it must be okay.
JUDGE03[11:21:03] yeah, it's like some kind of badge of courage or something
JUDGE03[11:21:15] but as a writer i do think that just pure info isn't all
JUDGE03[11:21:24] that interesting.  do you hang out in chat rooms?
CONFEDR[11:21:27] No way!
JUDGE03[11:21:41] oh i thought maybe i knew you.  you sure you aren't star
JUDGE03[11:21:52] lady from the weirdoMUD on aol?
CONFEDR[11:22:02] There are more tactful ways to chat a girl up, you know.
CONFEDR[11:22:12] I don't know what your success rate is but you're either
CONFEDR[11:22:22] very lucky or oblivious... :)
JUDGE03[11:22:35] yeah i guess i forgot that little one too :)  actually i
JUDGE03[11:22:45] don't consider myself lucky.  and i don't really get into
JUDGE03[11:22:56] too much up-chatting (chatting-up?) so i don't know what
JUDGE03[11:23:05] my success rate is?  should i be hitting the carriage return
JUDGE03[11:23:07] more often?
CONFEDR[11:23:14] Is that some sort of innuendo? 
JUDGE03[11:23:33] no, not really.  but if you want to consider it as such...i
JUDGE03[11:23:36] won't stop you.
CONFEDR[11:23:48] As to the Star Lady reference, let me explain. Women never
CONFEDR[11:23:56] like to think that they've confused with some other female
CONFEDR[11:24:03] in a guy's mind. It is just one of those things.
JUDGE03[11:24:35] i can't see you and all that but i would never confuse you
JUDGE03[11:24:44] with anyone else, especially not fred or thad, even tho
JUDGE03[11:24:53] i guess they technically are not women although i have my
JUDGE03[11:24:59] doubts that they have any idea who they are at all.
CONFEDR[11:25:18] Identity crisis time. Well, so tell me, what goes on in
CONFEDR[11:25:28] the aforementioned chat room at AOL?
JUDGE03[11:25:37] i just made it up i don't think such a thing exists.
CONFEDR[11:25:47] Don;t count on it. There's a shoe for every foot. I am not
CONFEDR[11:25:58] a big AOL fan. It's like the shopping mall arcade of th4e
CONFEDR[11:26:03] internet, isn't it??
JUDGE03[11:26:22] yeah, but i've gotten over hating it because it's so dumb
JUDGE03[11:26:32] it's interesting.  i got email on it a couple of years ago
JUDGE03[11:26:38] and -- hey write me.

JUDGE03[11:27:46] I hope not.  I'm pretty sure I'm judge 2.
CONFEDR[11:27:57] REally?? But you're the 4th.
JUDGE03[11:28:18] Right.  There are only five judges and 6 terminals here.
JUDGE03[11:28:28]  You missed out on the first round.  That's why you waited
JUDGE03[11:28:34] here for 20 minutes.
CONFEDR[11:28:45] I'll take your word for it. What else have you to say for
CONFEDR[11:28:47] yuorself today?
JUDGE03[11:29:00] Well, I'm damn glad you type faster than the last machine.
CONFEDR[11:29:14] Speed isn't everything. How often do you visit New York?
JUDGE03[11:29:25] When I was in high school, I was here all the time.  
CONFEDR[11:29:32] But now you're at Yale, aren'ty you>
JUDGE03[11:29:48] Yeah.  Don't get into NY much anymore.  Too expensive to
JUDGE03[11:29:51] come in on the train.
CONFEDR[11:30:09] Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Where did you live when you
CONFEDR[11:30:15] were growing up here?
JUDGE03[11:30:30] I lived about 20 minutes from the GWB, in northern NJ. 
JUDGE03[11:30:36] Did you grow up around here?
CONFEDR[11:30:44] Not really. But yes, in other ways.
JUDGE03[11:30:51] What am I to make of that?
CONFEDR[11:31:07] I moved here when I was a very young adult. So I did grow
CONFEDR[11:31:18] up here in many ways. I was not, howeverm born in the city,
CONFEDR[11:31:24] or anywhere very near to it.
JUDGE03[11:31:34] Gotcha.  Did you go to school here?  
CONFEDR[11:31:43] No. I'm a non-academic. 
JUDGE03[11:32:05] What are you doing these days?
CONFEDR[11:32:13] Writing and experimenting.
JUDGE03[11:32:20] Computer experimenting?  Arts?
CONFEDR[11:32:39] No No, I'm not especially computer-literate. I'm writing
CONFEDR[11:32:49] for various magazines and preparing a book proposal. 
JUDGE03[11:32:58] Sounds nice.  I am looking forward to getting to the point
JUDGE03[11:33:10] where I get to do stuff.  I am sick of school and have been
JUDGE03[11:33:13] for a few years now.  
CONFEDR[11:33:25] I dropped out rather early. I must say, I do admire anyone
CONFEDR[11:33:37] who has the kind of discipline you obviously have. 
JUDGE03[11:33:49] I sometimes wonder if it is discipline or neurosis?  Have
JUDGE03[11:34:00] you ever visited a high-pressure school?  It attracts lots
JUDGE03[11:34:16] of neurotic overachievers, lots of reward-motivated people.
JUDGE03[11:34:22]  It is a very strange place.
CONFEDR[11:34:34] I thnk I have visited a few high-pressure schools. However,
CONFEDR[11:34:44] when you're a visitor you don't feel any of the stuff you
CONFEDR[11:35:01] describe -- unless you are receptive to it. I have never
CONFEDR[11:35:14] visited Yale but I've been around the Columbia campus and
CONFEDR[11:35:33] also the campus of a well-known joint out west and, well,
CONFEDR[11:35:45] none of the other universities I have visited were probably
CONFEDR[11:35:55] high pressure establishments. NYU?
JUDGE03[11:36:08] I don't know.  I bet the grad schools at NYU are pretty
JUDGE03[11:36:20] high-pressure.  Actually, a friend of mine (an actor) is
JUDGE03[11:36:29] very scared to go to either NYU or Juilliard for that reason.
JUDGE03[11:36:42]  Apparently, it can be damaging.  Honestly, I don't mean
JUDGE03[11:36:53] to be so down about it, though.  Yale's a good place.
CONFEDR[11:37:04] I gave a little talk at the NYU drama school a few years
CONFEDR[11:37:19] ago. Between you and me, I'm very dubious of all these institutions.
CONFEDR[11:37:31] They're like gigantic bureacracies as far as I can see.
JUDGE03[11:37:42] Yeah.  When I was applying to schools, I was very interested
JUDGE03[11:37:52] in a place called Deep Springs, out in california.  It's
JUDGE03[11:38:04] a two-year program for 26 people, where you work on a ranch
JUDGE03[11:38:17] out in the middle of nowhere and take classes in the spare
JUDGE03[11:38:26] time.  It sounded like a nice change, but I never finished
JUDGE03[11:38:37] the application (5 essays or something.  I'm a terrible
JUDGE03[11:38:39] writer)
CONFEDR[11:39:05] listen, er, woukld you think it's rude if we move on to
CONFEDR[11:39:16] the next person? It's nothing personal but you'll undresrtand
CONFEDR[11:39:17] later....
JUDGE03[11:39:25] Um, sure.  Whatever works.
CONFEDR[11:39:52] okay thanks, I really appreciate it. I'll be nice to you
CONFEDR[11:39:55] later. Promise. Bye.
JUDGE03[11:40:00] bye
CONFEDR[11:40:28] hello?
CONFEDR[11:40:43] apparnelty I'm not allowed to do this, we have to keep chatting,.
JUDGE03[11:41:06] I just asked Dr. Loebner, oh, I see.  Yeah, I guess we're
JUDGE03[11:41:08] not allowed.
CONFEDR[11:41:27] i'll be right back?
JUDGE03[11:41:30] Sure...
CONFEDR[11:41:42] well that was a short break.
JUDGE03[11:41:52] Um.  Yeah.
CONFEDR[11:42:00] But isn't life more fun this way?
JUDGE03[11:42:15] More fun how?
CONFEDR[11:42:29] Well a little spontaneity and confusion often makes things
CONFEDR[11:42:32] more interesting.
JUDGE03[11:42:49] True.  This is a bit surreal.  Do you have to go?  I don't
JUDGE03[11:42:59] mind just sitting if you hve to do something (bathroom?)
CONFEDR[11:43:10] I went, couldn't you tell?
CONFEDR[11:43:24] Computers do core dumps quicker than most.
JUDGE03[11:43:29] Especially when I'm programming.
CONFEDR[11:43:41] Yes but then having to clean up the hard drive is a mess.
CONFEDR[11:43:57] Ah for a good programming environment and operating system
CONFEDR[11:44:09] that keeps up with and makes allowances for human error.
JUDGE03[11:44:24] Someday, someday.  User-interface is one of my interests,
JUDGE03[11:44:39] actually.  I'm pretty amazed at some of the interfaces I;ve
CONFEDR[11:44:53] seen,.  Although they're getting better.  It's amazing that
JUDGE03[11:45:07] even though computing power doubles every 1.5 years, we
JUDGE03[11:45:16] haven't seen any change in the user-interface since the
JUDGE03[11:45:19] Mac came out.
CONFEDR[11:45:35] Well wait a year and a half for the new Mac operating system.
CONFEDR[11:45:50] But playing with OS/2 the last day and a half has been a
CONFEDR[11:46:02] hell of a lot more fun than dealing with DOS.  Please, stop
CONFEDR[11:46:13] me before I DOS again. .....aaaaiiiggggghhh.
JUDGE03[11:46:28] I actually like command-line stuff sometimes.  Although
JUDGE03[11:46:41] I guess I'm thinking more of UNIX.  But I agree, OS/2 is
JUDGE03[11:46:45] really, really nice.
CONFEDR[11:47:04] let's change the subject, my dear. How many years did you
CONFEDR[11:47:10] say you have left in the clinker?
JUDGE03[11:47:25] I'm getting out in May.  Time;s up.  Nice talking to you.
CONFEDR[11:47:33] byeee
JUDGE03[11:47:54] @@01
*** JUDGE01 ***
START AT 1996/03/16  11:47:54
CONFEDR[11:48:09] hello there.
JUDGE01[11:48:22] hello. are there certain topics you are not comforatble
JUDGE01[11:48:26] discussing?
CONFEDR[11:48:44] well, I think I can handle myself if that should arise.
CONFEDR[11:48:46] And you?
JUDGE01[11:49:02] I'd rather not address topic of handling myself, but please
JUDGE01[11:49:06] go ahead
CONFEDR[11:49:25] very funny. You shall start -- why don't yuo lead, as it
CONFEDR[11:49:26] were?
JUDGE01[11:49:46] OK, but I'm also a reluctant dancer. Tell me about some
JUDGE01[11:50:00] of the topics you've discussed so far, so we can find something
CONFEDR[11:50:09] new to discuss.
CONFEDR[11:50:24] Everybody talks about the weather. It's amazing. Also, the
CONFEDR[11:50:37] movies. And education. But that doesn't mean we can't discuss
CONFEDR[11:50:46] those things if you have some compelling urge to do so.
JUDGE01[11:51:13] not at all. some of your colleagues offered jokes and other
CONFEDR[11:51:43] chit chat--you seem much more serious. What do you know about
JUDGE01[11:52:05] other contestants in this contest? Did you all travle together?
CONFEDR[11:52:18] I am not at liberty to discuss that. What's your name?
JUDGE01[11:52:45] I am judge01. Typically, not too judgemental, but gotta
JUDGE01[11:53:03] be today. Why are you interested in determining my name?
JUDGE01[11:53:13] (I'm not leading very well, am I?)
CONFEDR[11:53:22] Passive agressive, I see. 
JUDGE01[11:53:54] I've gotta mention--there seems to be a pattern(connection)
JUDGE01[11:54:10] between the replies I'm seeing on this flickering screen
JUDGE01[11:54:24] and the sound of keyboard being used behind this curtain
JUDGE01[11:54:38] over here. Any thoughts on that?
CONFEDR[11:54:52] It's all in your mind. What's the story with that?
JUDGE01[11:55:25] My mind is fullk of stories, and I've recevntly added to
JUDGE01[11:55:40] my cache of jokes. Not that size is important or anything
CONFEDR[11:55:52] , but how large is your cache of jokes?
CONFEDR[11:56:09] I used to know a few really tasteless ones but I haven't
CONFEDR[11:56:26] been very dutiful about collecting them latrely. I undersrtabnd
CONFEDR[11:56:35] Thadd is a great punmesister.
JUDGE01[11:56:59] Yes, I've heard that too. ?/What king of keybard are you
JUDGE01[11:57:06] using behind that curtain?
CONFEDR[11:57:19] Keybard! I love it. Very cute. 
JUDGE01[11:57:47] Yeah, I figured you'd appreciate a Shakespearean reference.
JUDGE01[11:58:11] When was the last time someonen asked you about the bard>?
CONFEDR[11:58:20] Last week? Smething like that. 
JUDGE01[11:58:30] ANd what sort of question were you asked?
CONFEDR[11:58:46] Hm. It was about one of his characters, not about him. 
JUDGE01[11:59:05] And probably not involving a keybard. ?/What sort of keyborad
JUDGE01[11:59:10] are you using at present?
CONFEDR[11:59:15] Why do you want to know?
JUDGE01[11:59:39] I have a side business consulting re: keyboards. I've desingned
JUDGE01[11:59:57] my own rig known as the keybard, and travel the country
JUDGE01[12:00:17] offering to entities like yourself. INterested?
CONFEDR[12:00:29] I have my own keyboard, thank you. You're talking to one
CONFEDR[12:00:39] of the least eager consumers ever. I am an extremely unwilling
CONFEDR[12:00:42] customer.
JUDGE01[12:01:01] Maybe if you got out from behind that curtain a little more
JUDGE01[12:01:27] often, you'd change your opinion. DO you know any Star tRek
CONFEDR[12:01:52] trivial--that seems to be popular with your colleagues.
CONFEDR[12:02:08] No! I'm not intersted in Science Fiction or any of thatr
CONFEDR[12:02:19] stuff, at all. I understand Fred is a Star Trek nut.
JUDGE01[12:02:44] Yes, most Star Trek nuts are Freds. How did you get involved
JUDGE01[12:02:48] in this contest?
CONFEDR[12:03:02] Hugh is one of my internet friends, We are on a few discussion
CONFEDR[12:03:14] groups and sometimes we run ideas by each other. He's quite
CONFEDR[12:03:18] the fellow, isn't he?
JUDGE01[12:03:32] Yes, agreed. In your next discussin, I really think you
JUDGE01[12:04:01] oughta mention contest design--you really need to break
JUDGE01[12:04:21] this (preceived) connection between keyborad licking and
JUDGE01[12:04:38] words streaming across the screen of this monitor. While
JUDGE01[12:05:08] you're at it, maybe larger, flicker-free monitors would
JUDGE01[12:05:25] be a good investment. What sort of machine is at the other
JUDGE01[12:05:35] end of wire hooked to thios machine?
CONFEDR[12:05:53] Same sas yours isn't it? A PC. As you probably know, our
CONFEDR[12:06:04] conversation is going to be permanently available to the
CONFEDR[12:06:15] public and that would actually include Hugh, so your sales
CONFEDR[12:06:21] pitch won't have to be repeated twice.
JUDGE01[12:06:51] wonderful! But I hope you'll consider my comments re: connectinos
CONFEDR[12:07:19] between keyboarding and replies. Also could you a backspace
JUDGE01[12:07:46] arangement, but you seem very fault-tolerant with my typos.
CONFEDR[12:07:52] oh. bye!
