human, hello?
human, well?
human, no doubt you say that to all the girls.
human, i understand. how long have you felt this way??
human, all right. let's clean it up. how's the weather?
human, actually i thought the air this morning was extremely refreshing.
human, aha.
human, no i meant... never mind. In this town. The center of the
human, weather universe.
human, New York?
human, Where are you from?
human, Er. India?
human, May I ask you a question?
human, How long have you lived away from bombay?
human, Is it rude to ask a person from your country what caste
human, their family is from?
human, How so?
human," I see. ""Tolerant of this question."" Meaning what? Is it"
human, considered to be a stupid tourist type question? So to speak...
human, Huh? The vietnam War is Over!
human, Is this a trick question? :)
human, But it's hardly the first time this has happened. Just another
human," Crusade(s) of another kind... As a younger person, I was"
human, opposed to the war because everyone in my environment was.
human, I cannot really think about Vietnam clearly -- it's completely
human, tied up with my childhood memories.
human, I understand. [Did you know the granite for the 'nam memorial
human, Wow. That's hard to answer. Let me think. For no reason
human," to do with her acting, Clara Bow. I like what she represented,"
human, but I don't know if I've ever seen a Clara Bow movie. I'm
human, drawing a blank on actresses for some off reason.
human," I meant ODD reason. I believe Clara Bow is dead, so she"
human, doesn't look like much of anything -- now.
human, Are you saying all these pink nudes on the walls of this
human, room with grape-tits and frizzly hair all look the same???
human," I haven't seen that yet. As a matter of fact, I have enjoyed"
human," the Italian movies I've seen. Many years ago, I saw a hilarious"
human," little number called ""I Hate Blondes"" about a man plagued"
human, by desire for a cartoonlike blonde streetwalker. It was
human, very sweet. American cinema is often too serious on some
human, level for me. Or tries to be serious. I think you know what
human, I mean.
human, are you a cmputer or a person?
human, When does middle age begin? I'm still passing for 20s.
human," Not 20, but 20s."
human, hello!
human," Very original. The weather, I mean. It has never done thus"
human, - this-- before.
human, Actually seems to be in a resting mode. This is a classic
human, April day.
human, Um. I believe it's April.
human, That's a very good question. Because months and days and
human, so on are arbitrary -- I suppose.
human, Really? You are somewhat reticent yourself.
human, I know.
human, Moi*?
human," And you? The strange thing is, there is an inescapable tendency"
human, to try to imitate the doings of a machine. I wonder why.
human, Hm. If you're so smart can't you tell?
human, Come on. Am I a male or a female??
human, What's repressed about me?
human, Not a chance. Anybody who is not repressed is in pretty
human, sad shape.
human," Because that is what civilization's all about. I mean, inorder"
human," to win friends, influence people and just basically live"
human, amongst others one must repress some desires and drives.
human, No?
human, Completely self-educated.
human, I'm not sure I would put it that way. I rejected formal
human, education at an early age.
human, Oy. I'm so flattered.
human, Hm. This conversation is public isn't it? I believe all
human, our interactions (during the contest) are available to the
human, public.
human, I don't think so. I'm extremely -- er-- I'm a clean freak.
human, Conversations like this make me very uptight.
human, Oh please. I haven't the foggiest about that. I'm too much
human, of a girl for that kind of thing.
human, Any particular director?
human, Yes? I never got around to that one. I ought to see it.
human, Is it as scary today as it was reputed to be when it came
human, out? Or does it seem corny?
human, I think I've seen ONE. But I can't recall. Hang on -- who
human," did that crazy flick starring Mary Shelley? I mean, it was"
human, about Mary Shelley -- Gothic? That was Ken....
human," No, I don't think so. Someone with an older reputation."
human, OK< it wasn't Kubrick... Name a few Kurbick movies. Maybe
human, I;ve seen one.
human, Fine.
human," Oh, the Shining. That was Kubrick? I saw rthat. Oops."
human, I imagine so. It somehow doesn't seem like it would be one
human, of his most interesting. I found it stimulating but nothing
human," amazingly brilliant, surely. I am not a big horror fan."
human, Terrified out of my mind. But so what? That in itseklf is
human, not a fascinating experience. I'm terrified every time I
human," try to cross the street -- well, not quite. But you get"
human, the idea.
human," Charmed, I'm sure."
human," Hello, Judge #3. How are you?"
human, Are they here with you today? I don't understand.
human," Oh, I never did underastand that particular refernece. I've"
human, seen it in Wired and in various pop culture places. What
human, the hell does it mean? Ones and Zeros.
human, Sheesh. Guess I'm still on.
human, How do you know I don't want my oicture taken?
human, ARe you someone I've met?
human," It's not a job, my dear. It's an ... adventure of sorts."
human, Hugh is a pal of mine. We met on the 'net and for some reason
human," he thinks I'm an excellent example of... humanity? HUmanness,"
human, I guess.
human," No, I wouldn't go that far."
human, Bots?
human, So tell me about the Star Trek thing. I've never really
human," ""gotten"" that show. But those who do seem to watch nothing"
human, else.
human," Hm. Oh, I think I understand. Do the programs have names?"
human, TQ
human," Yes, I do. And you?"
human, A lot of techies seem to live in Brooklyn.
human, Where the hell are you *from*?
human, I see. What part of Brooklyn are you in and do you like
human, it?
human, I'm sorry but you can't withdraw that question. I saw it!
human, I am probably too staid for your band.
human, I have enjoyed some of Hank Williams and that sort of thing
human, but my favorite kind of music to listen to live is Eartha
human," Kitt, Peggy Lee, obby Short, that kind of thing. I also"
human, like the Blues.
human, Yanni? That endless din -- I heard it when I was in Greece.
human, He's like a national folk hero for the young set. I can't
human, stand it. It's like New Age music.
human, I havenm't seen andrea marcovicci but i suspect I would
human, like her.
human, How sweet. That's the first time I've ever heard that. (eyelash
human, fluttering)
human," You know, if there's one thing I can't stand it's these"
human," peolpe who send out endless e-mail, screens long, filled"
human, with sloppy typos and spelling errors. I am on a few list
human, serve discussion groups and I cannot believe the stuff I've
human," seen. Graphic types don't care about punctuation, etc. They"
human, probably figure that if the machine is willing to send the
human," thing, it must be okay."
human, No way!
human," There are more tactful ways to chat a girl up, you know."
human, I don't know what your success rate is but you're either
human, very lucky or oblivious... :)
human, Is that some sort of innuendo?
human," As to the Star Lady reference, let me explain. Women never"
human, like to think that they've confused with some other female
human, in a guy's mind. It is just one of those things.
human," Identity crisis time. Well, so tell me, what goes on in"
human, the aforementioned chat room at AOL?
human, Don;t count on it. There's a shoe for every foot. I am not
human, a big AOL fan. It's like the shopping mall arcade of th4e
human," internet, isn't it??"
human, I beg your pardon?
human, I thought I already spoke to Judge #2?
human, REally?? But you're the 4th.
human, I'll take your word for it. What else have you to say for
human, yuorself today?
human, Speed isn't everything. How often do you visit New York?
human," But now you're at Yale, aren'ty you>"
human," Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Where did you live when you"
human, were growing up here?
human," Not really. But yes, in other ways."
human, I moved here when I was a very young adult. So I did grow
human," up here in many ways. I was not, howeverm born in the city,"
human, or anywhere very near to it.
human, No. I'm a non-academic.
human, Writing and experimenting.
human," No No, I'm not especially computer-literate. I'm writing"
human, for various magazines and preparing a book proposal.
human," I dropped out rather early. I must say, I do admire anyone"
human, who has the kind of discipline you obviously have.
human," I thnk I have visited a few high-pressure schools. However,"
human, when you're a visitor you don't feel any of the stuff you
human, describe -- unless you are receptive to it. I have never
human, visited Yale but I've been around the Columbia campus and
human," also the campus of a well-known joint out west and, well,"
human, none of the other universities I have visited were probably
human, high pressure establishments. NYU?
human, I gave a little talk at the NYU drama school a few years
human," ago. Between you and me, I'm very dubious of all these institutions."
human, They're like gigantic bureacracies as far as I can see.
human," listen, er, woukld you think it's rude if we move on to"
human, the next person? It's nothing personal but you'll undresrtand
human, later....
human," okay thanks, I really appreciate it. I'll be nice to you"
human, later. Promise. Bye.
human, hello?
human," apparnelty I'm not allowed to do this, we have to keep chatting,."
human, i'll be right back?
human, well that was a short break.
human, But isn't life more fun this way?
human, Well a little spontaneity and confusion often makes things
human, more interesting.
human," I went, couldn't you tell?"
human, Computers do core dumps quicker than most.
human, Yes but then having to clean up the hard drive is a mess.
human, Ah for a good programming environment and operating system
human, that keeps up with and makes allowances for human error.
human," seen,.  Although they're getting better.  It's amazing that"
human, Well wait a year and a half for the new Mac operating system.
human, But playing with OS/2 the last day and a half has been a
human," hell of a lot more fun than dealing with DOS.  Please, stop"
human, me before I DOS again. .....aaaaiiiggggghhh.
human," let's change the subject, my dear. How many years did you"
human, say you have left in the clinker?
human, byeee
human, hello there.
human," well, I think I can handle myself if that should arise."
human, And you?
human," very funny. You shall start -- why don't yuo lead, as it"
human, were?
human, new to discuss.
human," Everybody talks about the weather. It's amazing. Also, the"
human, movies. And education. But that doesn't mean we can't discuss
human, those things if you have some compelling urge to do so.
human, chit chat--you seem much more serious. What do you know about
human, I am not at liberty to discuss that. What's your name?
human," Passive agressive, I see."
human, It's all in your mind. What's the story with that?
human," , but how large is your cache of jokes?"
human, I used to know a few really tasteless ones but I haven't
human, been very dutiful about collecting them latrely. I undersrtabnd
human, Thadd is a great punmesister.
human, Keybard! I love it. Very cute.
human, Last week? Smething like that.
human," Hm. It was about one of his characters, not about him."
human, Why do you want to know?
human," I have my own keyboard, thank you. You're talking to one"
human, of the least eager consumers ever. I am an extremely unwilling
human, customer.
human, trivial--that seems to be popular with your colleagues.
human, No! I'm not intersted in Science Fiction or any of thatr
human," stuff, at all. I understand Fred is a Star Trek nut."
human," Hugh is one of my internet friends, We are on a few discussion"
human, groups and sometimes we run ideas by each other. He's quite
human," the fellow, isn't he?"
human," Same sas yours isn't it? A PC. As you probably know, our"
human, conversation is going to be permanently available to the
human," public and that would actually include Hugh, so your sales"
human, pitch won't have to be repeated twice.
human, between keyboarding and replies. Also could you a backspace
human, oh. bye!

program,"...sorry, forgot the extra RETURN..."

program,on an airplane?
program,"Your friend andrew would say, that's amusing."

program,"are you female? what's your sign, baby??"
program,What does a woman want anyway?
program,Why don't you much care either way?
program,I clearly remember you said what is your interest in
program,gender? you never told me if you are a man or a woman??
program,That's certainly an interesting response.
program,Do you say you have no idea where to begin for some
program,special reason?
program,I think you said that you want what? I thought you were
program,going to curse at me. did you get cold feet??Is that the real reason?

program,why not?
program,Buying a pentium computer for your kids is like killing
program,an ant with a sledgehammer!.
program,Just what you want to be you will be in the end.
program,"We were discussing you, not me."
program,I'm sure you said did you just get a pentium??
program,I want my red car right now so hurry.
program,Why do you say that about your roommate has a pentium?
program,Iam going to give you 10 more minutes you sucker! would
program,you like to be shot or stabbed? oh well iam going to
program,do both ! you are.

program,you.?

program,But you said I want to know why you are asking so many
program,questions.?
program,I have not yet been able to answer the great question
program,that has never been answered: what does a woman want?
program,Perhaps I already knew you were supposed to ask i questions--has
program,there been a change in plans.
program,"Eat chicken, fish, salad and a side order of fried poop!."

program,anything else to you?

program,say we have carpets - ha ha.

program,Have you asked such questions before?
program,But you said what do you do when you get angry??
program,"True art selects and paraphrases, but seldom gives a"
program,verbatim translation.
program,Have you asked anyone else?
program,That's not a response to my comment.
program,I understand.
program,Women are wiser than men because they know less and
program,understand more.
program,Do you wish that it is not a response?
program,"Small bands of men, armed only with wallets, besieged"
program,"by a hords of wives and children - is that real life,"
program,or what?

program,"hour, eat at least once a day."
