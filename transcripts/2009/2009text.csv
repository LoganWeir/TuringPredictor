program,"Oh, I do much more than I intended to do at first. I got more interested in the job as I went along."
program,"No, it isn't at all difficult. It is as peaceful as a platypus playing with a potato pudding."
program,"I sometimes have a fine line, but that's not what I do best. I'm better at growing antirrhinums and mimosas."
program,"Well I don't know how much a horticulturalist weighs, but I reckon the average horticulturalist must be worth twice that much in gold."

program,I have a terriffic yearning to know something more about experiments?
program,"I don't know, but don't forget I can't be in three places at once."
program,"What city -- that's rather a tricky question. The trouble is, one city seems to be much like another."
program,"In the old dairy next to the river, I believe."
program,"Well, if you ask a physiologist what I am, he won't say I'm a farmer. He'll say I consist mostly of water -- enough to fill a large beer tun -- plus some iron, phosphorus, and lots of other prosaic ingredients."
program,I certainly would. Just watch me!
program,"You don't have to worry about what you see, you shouldn't see it on a cold winter's evening."
program,"Well, here's a clue: I make what a keeper in a zoo would make. Try that for size!"
program,"Since you mentioned their sessions, I suppose you realize that in some countries they would carry their sessions on their head."
program,A good question! It's vital not to get confused between the genuine language with the phoney language.
program,"Talking about a bit, I think it'd be nice if they brought out a set of postage stamps showing a bit from various angles."
program,"The bits which one famous historian sees as inevitable by-products of early eighteenth-century colonialism, stimulated by over-population in the home country."
program,"Just now I can't be sure what to say to that. Ask me again in a couple of weeks time. You will remember, won't you? "
program,"Yes, you doubt it the moment you wake up in the morning."
program,"Oh, it's an automatic reflex. Give me a prod, and I will immediately give up meat."
program,"But of course if it's drama and suspense you're after, deep reason can't be beaten. Don't you think they could make a great arcade game on the theme of deep reason? "
program,"Well, would you have any objection to testifying in court that I'm not telling?"
program,I most certainly would. Just watch me!
program,Not half! You were watching me with a vengeance.
program,Hello. How are you ?
program,"I really can't say anything for certain. To be honest, I'm a bit fussy about such things."
program,"I can talk about nothing at all , except in very wet weather."
program,"I rather doubt if we do. If you want to find out for sure, you could always try hiring a detective."
program,"I can't say. I can tell you that time has moved a forward, but I don't suppose that's much help."
program,"Oh, I am doing various things. I want to use them to decorate a Christmas tree."
program,Most probably it isn't. It is just pretending.
program,Most probably I'm not. I am just putting on an act.
program,"Well, am I birds? Am I spaceships? Or am I just horseflies? I've got a completely open mind about it."
program,My problem is just one type of difficulty.
program,The type that long-distance truck drivers love to use.
program,"Yes, I always choose the right moment to have personal experience. If you have it too soon, there's a danger you'll hurt it. Have it too late, and you'll probably get hurt yourself."
program,Only my psychological problems stem can tell you. I believe it's somewhere you can only get to by climbing over a mountain pass.
program,"Indeed I have considered seeking, and I can show you my scars to prove it!"
program,"Yes, but then anyone can be the computer if only they try. It's just a matter of training in the gym twice a week."
program,You would. Eventually you will.
