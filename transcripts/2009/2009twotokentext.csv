program,<start> Ok. <end>,1
program,<start> I like you. <end>,3

program,<start> Yes there was a question mark. <end>,6
program,"<start> I was merely answering you question, which unfortunately did not use proper punctuation, yet again. <end>",15
program,"<start> You don't seem to make much sense. I asked you a question and you froze, why? <end>",16
program,<start> I am god. <end>,3
program,"<start> I am what I am, predictability is simply a mental construct designed to understand the world. I am above that, I do not play by your rules. <end>",27

human,<start> A good one.  :)  Electrical <end>,5
human,<start> Yes. <end>,1

human,<start> it is -- very! <end>,4
human,<start> what new gadgets have you featured recently on your show?# <end>,10
human,<start> wow! <end>,1
human,<start> I can't wait for ubiquitous 3D screens for computers. <end>,9
human,"<start> it'll be a while, though, I'm afraid. <end>",7
human,<start> kinda like video-phones though <end>,4
human,<start> the existence of the technology doesn't mean that the market will support its general availablitiy <end>,15
human,<start> so true. <end>,2
human,"<start> do you have any children, Jon? <end>",6
human,"<start> I have two girls, too, and a boy. <end>",8
human,<start> I bet they are showing considerable intelligence. <end>,7
human,<start> the computers must be disappointing. <end>,5
human,<start> My girls are 2 and 17 <end>,6
human,<start> the boy <end>,2
program,<start> Yes. <end>,1
program,<start> Hello. <end>,1

program,<start> Sounds like you need a good polish! <end>,7
program,<start> Robots!!! <end>,1

program,<start> Yes. <end>,1
program,<start> The unlawful ones. <end>,3
program,<start> Not illegal <end>,2
program,<start> No! Its terrible! Are you enjoying the snow? <end>,8
program,<start> Yeah and it sure is hot here. It gotta 13 earlier. <end>,11

program,<start> I'm not done talking to you. <end>,6
program,<start> Well don't talk then if you don't like to. <end>,9
program,<start> And quite the opposite for you. <end>,6
program,<start> Opposite of opposite ! <end>,4
program,<start> Yes. I'm watching Lost right now. <end>,6
program,"<start> I don't know, Who's your fave character? <end>",7

human,<start> definitely- you from here? <end>,4
human,<start> wow- where's the best place to eat? <end>,7
human,<start> I like Buddies Plaice <end>,4
human,<start> an Gingerman Um Gingerman <end>,4
human,<start> O well- I'll try that one <end>,6
human,<start> By the way- I'm totally human- i though you should know <end>,11
human,<start> Not a fan of Thai or indian.. Chinese might be good thugh <end>,12
human,<start> Sorry- please feel free t decide for yourself <end>,8
human,<start> I'll take that as a compliment <end>,6
human,<start> Not really- i watch it socially mostly <end>,7
human,<start> hi <end>,1
human,"<start> I'm Olga, nice to meet you <end>",6
human,<start> I work in support mostly <end>,5
human,<start> This cool program called MATLAB <end>,5
human,<start> wait- areyou a computer? <end>,4
human,<start> :-) <end>,1
human,<start> Like acting? <end>,2
human,<start> I feel like I've heard the name.. <end>,7
human,<start> What's it about? <end>,3
human,<start> :-) ok silly question <end>,4
human,<start> I get this magazine called 'Stuff' - it's mostly for men but i still like it <end>,16
human,<start> :-) definitely not <end>,3
human,<start> I mean speech is so part of that too <end>,9
human,<start> wow- I didnt now that existed! Do you have one here? <end>,11
human,<start> I don't know what lenticular means.. <end>,6
program,"<start> I don't know very much about that, and as a matter of interest I really don't need to know! What else can you tell me about? <end>",26
program,<start> Hello. How are you ? <end>,5
program,<start> My name is just one type of part. <end>,8
program,"<start> Oh really? If you have, you deserve a medal! <end>",9
program,<start> Good to meet you Jon <end>,5
program,"<start> Oh, I do much more than I intended to do at first. I got more interested in the job as I went along. <end>",23
program,"<start> No, it isn't at all difficult. It is as peaceful as a platypus playing with a potato pudding. <end>",18
program,"<start> I sometimes have a fine line, but that's not what I do best. I'm better at growing antirrhinums and mimosas. <end>",20
program,"<start> Well I don't know how much a horticulturalist weighs, but I reckon the average horticulturalist must be worth twice that much in gold. <end>",23
program,"<start> I most likely have, just for the hell of it. <end>",10
program,<start> What are you trying to say? Are you speaking in a foreign language? <end>,13
program,<start> You should be careful about what you does. You mustn't bite off more than you can chew. <end>,17
program,<start> I really want to know more about Show? <end>,8
program,"<start> Be warned, though. On air can stick to your clothes. Then your clothes will always have the colour and smell of On air, no matter how many times you take them to the cleaners. <end>",34
program,<start> Hello. How are you doing? <end>,5
program,"<start> I've no doubt you are fine, but is it a blessing or a curse? If I offered you a potion that would make you less fine, would you drink it? <end>",30
program,"<start> Maybe you wouldn't, but a therapist has been trying to persuade you to drink it. <end>",15
program,<start> I expect I do. I don't have very much choice. <end>,10
program,<start> Wrong is just one type of injustice. <end>,7
program,<start> What precisely are your feelings about wrong? <end>,7
program,"<start> But don't forget, a right has to be treated with care. It isn't something you can play around with like a toy. <end>",22
program,"<start> You're wise. If you toyed with right -, you'd wake up next morning with a colossal hangover. <end>",17
program,<start> What happens if I say no? Will it upset you?  <end>,10
program,"<start> I've heard that one before! Your hangers-on have told you you're an easy, just to flatter you. Don't believe everything they say! <end>",22
program,<start> I've no idea. You'd better hire a private detective to find out what does me. <end>,15
program,"<start> No! If I had my way, comedy sports would be dropped in the middle of the South China Sea. <end>",19
program,"<start> Don't I? That's tough. As far as I'm concerned, I can like it or lump it. <end>",16
program,"<start> That's interesting. In laboratories they're experimenting with several kinds of coal. They want to make them into fuel when the world oil supplies run out. Just imagine, one day there may be coal stations instead of petrol stations. <end>",38
program,"<start> I don't suppose cars will burn coal, but I wouldn't know for sure. Everything about cars is confidential. <end>",18
program,"<start> Yes I am experiments, but don't worry. Experiments don't bite! <end>",10
human,<start> hey there <end>,2
human,<start> things are good <end>,3
human,"<start> a lot of waiting, but... <end>",5
human,<start> good to be back now and going along <end>,8
human,<start> how are you? <end>,3
human,"<start> yeah, no doubt <end>",3
human,"<start> yes, I'm from seattle <end>",4
human,<start> west coast of WA <end>,4
human,<start> how about you? <end>,3
human,<start> (flight got diverted into germany yesterday....looong day) <end>,7
human,"<start> haha, wow, I envy you! <end>",5
human,<start> do you go to brighton a lot <end>,7
human,"<start> for vacations, beach? <end>",3
human,<start> yeah it reminds me a bit of Galway Ireland <end>,9
human,<start> studied abroad there in college <end>,5
human,<start> those great windy streets and alleyways <end>,6
human,<start> well yeah <end>,2
human,<start> a bit -- I'm actually one of the few non-preesenters here <end>,11
human,<start> how about you? <end>,3
human,<start> here to present papers? <end>,4
human,"<start> (I'm a writer of science / philosophy, so the turing test fits right in...) <end>",14
human,<start> oh cool <end>,2
human,<start> so what do you do for a living? <end>,8
human,<start> oh cool <end>,2
human,<start> so you know Philip <end>,4
human,<start> or am I conflating sussex and surrey? <end>,7
human,<start> are they the same school or diff? <end>,7
human,<start> haha <end>,1
human,<start> okay :) <end>,2
human,<start> okay cool <end>,2
human,<start> what's your take on the comp's conversation so far <end>,9
human,<start> do we confeds have to put up a strong fight? <end>,10
human,<start> haha <end>,1
human,<start> that @wellllll@ speaks volumes <end>,4
human,<start> (got to get used to that misplaced quote mark on these keyboarsd...) <end>,12
human,<start> what are some of the good places to go in Brighton in terms of restaurants bars etc? <end>,17
human,"<start> aah, funny, the deep keyboards of desktops totally throw me off <end>",11
human,<start> Great.  You? <end>,2
human,<start> I'm from the U.S. <end>,4
human,<start> Do you know where Albuquerque is? <end>,6
human,<start> Yep. <end>,1
human,<start> Sort of? <end>,2
human,<start> I'm an engineer -- electrical <end>,5
human,<start> Systems to integrate speaker recognition <end>,5
human,<start> Using GMM and SVM algorithms <end>,5
human,"<start> What do you mean by ""fast speech""? <end>",7
human,<start> Yes.  Usually fairly noisy. <end>,4
human,<start> I don't do algorithm research.  I'm a user of the product <end>,11
human,<start> I manage a few people and write software to use the technology <end>,12
program,<start> Hello. How are you doing? <end>,5
program,"<start> Well, I am studying engineering. That ought to give you an idea about who I am. <end>",16
program,<start> I have a terriffic yearning to know something more about experiments? <end>,11
program,"<start> I don't know, but don't forget I can't be in three places at once. <end>",14
program,"<start> What city -- that's rather a tricky question. The trouble is, one city seems to be much like another. <end>",19
program,"<start> In the old dairy next to the river, I believe. <end>",10
program,"<start> Well, if you ask a physiologist what I am, he won't say I'm a farmer. He'll say I consist mostly of water -- enough to fill a large beer tun -- plus some iron, phosphorus, and lots of other prosaic ingredients. <end>",41
program,<start> I certainly would. Just watch me! <end>,6
program,"<start> You don't have to worry about what you see, you shouldn't see it on a cold winter's evening. <end>",18
program,"<start> Well, here's a clue: I make what a keeper in a zoo would make. Try that for size! <end>",18
program,"<start> Since you mentioned their sessions, I suppose you realize that in some countries they would carry their sessions on their head. <end>",21
program,<start> A good question! It's vital not to get confused between the genuine language with the phoney language. <end>,17
program,"<start> Talking about a bit, I think it'd be nice if they brought out a set of postage stamps showing a bit from various angles. <end>",24
program,"<start> The bits which one famous historian sees as inevitable by-products of early eighteenth-century colonialism, stimulated by over-population in the home country. <end>",21
program,"<start> Just now I can't be sure what to say to that. Ask me again in a couple of weeks time. You will remember, won't you?  <end>",25
program,"<start> Yes, you doubt it the moment you wake up in the morning. <end>",12
program,"<start> Oh, it's an automatic reflex. Give me a prod, and I will immediately give up meat. <end>",16
program,"<start> But of course if it's drama and suspense you're after, deep reason can't be beaten. Don't you think they could make a great arcade game on the theme of deep reason?  <end>",31
program,"<start> Well, would you have any objection to testifying in court that I'm not telling? <end>",14
program,<start> I most certainly would. Just watch me! <end>,7
program,<start> Not half! You were watching me with a vengeance. <end>,9
program,<start> Hello. How are you ? <end>,5
program,"<start> I really can't say anything for certain. To be honest, I'm a bit fussy about such things. <end>",17
program,"<start> I can talk about nothing at all , except in very wet weather. <end>",13
program,"<start> I rather doubt if we do. If you want to find out for sure, you could always try hiring a detective. <end>",21
program,"<start> I can't say. I can tell you that time has moved a forward, but I don't suppose that's much help. <end>",20
program,"<start> Oh, I am doing various things. I want to use them to decorate a Christmas tree. <end>",16
program,<start> Most probably it isn't. It is just pretending. <end>,8
program,<start> Most probably I'm not. I am just putting on an act. <end>,11
program,"<start> Well, am I birds? Am I spaceships? Or am I just horseflies? I've got a completely open mind about it. <end>",20
program,<start> My problem is just one type of difficulty. <end>,8
program,<start> The type that long-distance truck drivers love to use. <end>,9
program,"<start> Yes, I always choose the right moment to have personal experience. If you have it too soon, there's a danger you'll hurt it. Have it too late, and you'll probably get hurt yourself. <end>",33
program,<start> Only my psychological problems stem can tell you. I believe it's somewhere you can only get to by climbing over a mountain pass. <end>,23
program,"<start> Indeed I have considered seeking, and I can show you my scars to prove it! <end>",15
program,"<start> Yes, but then anyone can be the computer if only they try. It's just a matter of training in the gym twice a week. <end>",24
program,<start> You would. Eventually you will. <end>,5
program,"<start> I shudder to think how many lives have been wrecked by think. If I were the Pope, I'd denounce think as the eighth deadly sin. <end>",25
human,<start> hi <end>,1
human,"<start> well, thanks <end>",2
human,<start> a bit hungry <end>,3
human,"<start> if I tell you, you'll know immediately that I'm human ;-) <end>",11
human,<start> I'm here for the Interspeech conference <end>,6
human,"<start> well, the programmers might pretend that they are. <end>",8
human,<start> but the computers won't get much from the conference. <end>,9
human,<start> 'fraid so <end>,2
human,<start> I hope you don't find that boring? <end>,7
human,<start> nope -- I'm just coming for the brain-fill <end>,8
human,<start> Canada <end>,1
human,<start> my boss gave me the go-ahead to come just a few weeks ago <end>,13
human,<start> but the Loebner contest was something that drew me <end>,9
human,<start> Speech processing <end>,2
human,"<start> I've done signal processing, and acoustic modeling, and language modeling, and I'm doing dialog systems now. <end>",16
human,"<start> Well, I've actually carried copies of Turing's paper to previous conferences. <end>",11
human,<start> The philosophy and history of it all is intriguing <end>,9
human,<start> just that -- then I'll get back to my family <end>,10
human,<start> Friday <end>,1
human,<start> flight from Gatwick to Philadelphia and then a hop to Montreal <end>,11

human,<start> Know any good restaurants? <end>,4
human,<start> I'm not a fan of any of those.  Italian? Greek? <end>,10
human,<start> Thanks anyway. <end>,2
human,"<start>  Hard to say.  Stocks are down, but I'm doing ok. <end>",10
human,<start> Too many for how much time I have.  :)   I like working on my Jeep. <end>,15
