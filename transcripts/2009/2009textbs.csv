human,"aah, funny, the deep keyboards of desktops totally throw me off"
program,Hello. How are you doing?
program,"I've no doubt you are fine, but is it a blessing or a curse? If I offered you a potion that would make you less fine, would you drink it?"
program,"Maybe you wouldn't, but a therapist has been trying to persuade you to drink it."
program,I expect I do. I don't have very much choice.
program,Wrong is just one type of injustice.
program,What precisely are your feelings about wrong?
program,"But don't forget, a right has to be treated with care. It isn't something you can play around with like a toy."
program,"You're wise. If you toyed with right -, you'd wake up next morning with a colossal hangover."
program,What happens if I say no? Will it upset you? 
program,"I've heard that one before! Your hangers-on have told you you're an easy, just to flatter you. Don't believe everything they say!"
program,I've no idea. You'd better hire a private detective to find out what does me.
program,"No! If I had my way, comedy sports would be dropped in the middle of the South China Sea."
program,"Don't I? That's tough. As far as I'm concerned, I can like it or lump it."
program,"That's interesting. In laboratories they're experimenting with several kinds of coal. They want to make them into fuel when the world oil supplies run out. Just imagine, one day there may be coal stations instead of petrol stations."
program,"I don't suppose cars will burn coal, but I wouldn't know for sure. Everything about cars is confidential."
program,"Yes I am experiments, but don't worry. Experiments don't bite!"
program,Hello. How are you doing?
program,"Well, I am studying engineering. That ought to give you an idea about who I am."
program,I have a terriffic yearning to know something more about experiments?
program,"I don't know, but don't forget I can't be in three places at once."
program,"What city -- that's rather a tricky question. The trouble is, one city seems to be much like another."
program,"In the old dairy next to the river, I believe."
program,"Well, if you ask a physiologist what I am, he won't say I'm a farmer. He'll say I consist mostly of water -- enough to fill a large beer tun -- plus some iron, phosphorus, and lots of other prosaic ingredients."
program,I certainly would. Just watch me!
program,"You don't have to worry about what you see, you shouldn't see it on a cold winter's evening."
program,"Well, here's a clue: I make what a keeper in a zoo would make. Try that for size!"
program,"Since you mentioned their sessions, I suppose you realize that in some countries they would carry their sessions on their head."
program,A good question! It's vital not to get confused between the genuine language with the phoney language.
program,"Talking about a bit, I think it'd be nice if they brought out a set of postage stamps showing a bit from various angles."
program,"The bits which one famous historian sees as inevitable by-products of early eighteenth-century colonialism, stimulated by over-population in the home country."
program,"Just now I can't be sure what to say to that. Ask me again in a couple of weeks time. You will remember, won't you? "
program,"Yes, you doubt it the moment you wake up in the morning."
program,"Oh, it's an automatic reflex. Give me a prod, and I will immediately give up meat."
program,"But of course if it's drama and suspense you're after, deep reason can't be beaten. Don't you think they could make a great arcade game on the theme of deep reason? "
program,"Well, would you have any objection to testifying in court that I'm not telling?"
program,I most certainly would. Just watch me!
program,Not half! You were watching me with a vengeance.
human,Great.  You?
human,I'm from the U.S.
human,Do you know where Albuquerque is?
human,Yep.
human,Sort of?
human,I'm an engineer -- electrical
human,Systems to integrate speaker recognition
human,Using GMM and SVM algorithms
human,"What do you mean by ""fast speech""?"
human,Yes.  Usually fairly noisy.
human,I don't do algorithm research.  I'm a user of the product
human,I manage a few people and write software to use the technology
human,hi
human,"well, thanks"
human,a bit hungry
human,"if I tell you, you'll know immediately that I'm human ;-)"
human,I'm here for the Interspeech conference
human,"well, the programmers might pretend that they are."
human,but the computers won't get much from the conference.
human,'fraid so
human,I hope you don't find that boring?
human,nope -- I'm just coming for the brain-fill
human,Canada
human,my boss gave me the go-ahead to come just a few weeks ago
human,but the Loebner contest was something that drew me
human,Speech processing
human,"I've done signal processing, and acoustic modeling, and language modeling, and I'm doing dialog systems now."
human,"Well, I've actually carried copies of Turing's paper to previous conferences."

human,just that -- then I'll get back to my family
human,Friday
human,flight from Gatwick to Philadelphia and then a hop to Montreal
program,Hello. How are you ?
program,"I really can't say anything for certain. To be honest, I'm a bit fussy about such things."
program,"I can talk about nothing at all , except in very wet weather."
program,"I rather doubt if we do. If you want to find out for sure, you could always try hiring a detective."
program,"I can't say. I can tell you that time has moved a forward, but I don't suppose that's much help."
program,"Oh, I am doing various things. I want to use them to decorate a Christmas tree."
program,Most probably it isn't. It is just pretending.
program,Most probably I'm not. I am just putting on an act.
program,"Well, am I birds? Am I spaceships? Or am I just horseflies? I've got a completely open mind about it."
program,My problem is just one type of difficulty.
program,The type that long-distance truck drivers love to use.
program,"Yes, I always choose the right moment to have personal experience. If you have it too soon, there's a danger you'll hurt it. Have it too late, and you'll probably get hurt yourself."
program,Only my psychological problems stem can tell you. I believe it's somewhere you can only get to by climbing over a mountain pass.
program,"Indeed I have considered seeking, and I can show you my scars to prove it!"
program,"Yes, but then anyone can be the computer if only they try. It's just a matter of training in the gym twice a week."
program,You would. Eventually you will.
program,"I shudder to think how many lives have been wrecked by think. If I were the Pope, I'd denounce think as the eighth deadly sin."
program,Hello and greetings.
