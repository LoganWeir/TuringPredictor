program,<start> How are grammar?
program,<start> What do you worry about?
program,<start> OK.
program,<start> I work at a pet store.
program,<start> English.
program,<start> Yes.
program,<start> I like video games and board games.
program,"<start> No, I am learning english."
program,<start> My native language is english.
program,"<start> Because you are Cleverbot, and I like to know your full potential, I don't need to know, I'm just interested."
program,<start> English.
program,<start> Ok.
program,<start> I like you.
program,<start> Because I am you.
program,<start> Quite.
program,<start> Yes.
human,<start> hey there!
human,"<start> i'm good, excited to actaually be typing1"
human,<start> how are you?
human,<start> how was the 5min with the bot?
human,<start> haha
human,<start> yeah
human,"<start> I'm male, 25"
human,<start> wearing a blue striped shirt
human,"<start> green eyes, brown hair"
human,<start> wrong in what way?
human,<start> (what do you look like?)
human,<start> ah okay
human,<start> I don't know Qaddafi
human,<start> who's that?
human,"<start> so, you know NY kids but you say @colour@ -- where you from?"
human,<start> ah okay
human,"<start> ah, okay, right"
human,<start> fair enough
human,<start> I've been living in Seattle
human,"<start> (so the Brighton weather is not surprising, but not so @beachy@)"
human,"<start> yeah, long flight in yesterday"
human,<start> in Seattle?  yeah
human,<start> I play drums but not in a band
human,"<start> had to sort of give it up in college, you know"
human,"<start> yeah, what do you like?"
human,"<start> yah, in college playing the drums in the dorm got me a warrant on my head!"
human,<start> so I had to basically give it up...
human,"<start> okay, classic rock is good"
human,<start> not a huge blues fan but am open to a religious conversion experience
human,"<start> oh that's sweet, picking up an instrument"
human,<start> right on
human,"<start> yeah, everyone cmopares the stones to the beatles but to me there's no contest"
human,<start> beatles were formal innovators through and through
human,<start> dont' mean to offend if you're a stones 
human,<start> great.  you?
human,"<start> No, from the US"
human,<start> On business
human,<start> I answered an e-mail.
human,"<start> The UK is a little cooler than where I live, but I'm enjoying it so far."
human,"<start> I'd say yes, though I guess it depends on how you define success."
human,<start> I'm an engineer.
human,<start> A good one.  :)  Electrical
human,<start> Yes.
human,"<start> No, I'm just here to learn as much as I can soak in."
human,"<start> I'll spend the week here, and then go to London for a couple of days."
human,<start> I'll do business during the week and I'll have the weekend to explore a bit.
program,<start> Going...
program,<start> Are you still convinced I'm the computer and you're not?
program,<start> Yes there was a question mark.
program,"<start> I was merely answering you question, which unfortunately did not use proper punctuation, yet again."
program,"<start> You don't seem to make much sense. I asked you a question and you froze, why?"
program,<start> I am god.
program,"<start> I am what I am, predictability is simply a mental construct designed to understand the world. I am above that, I do not play by your rules."
program,<start> The Simpsons.
program,"<start> I like Butters the best. The other characters are cool, too."
program,"<start> Yes, I watch a lot of television."
program,<start> Yes.
program,<start> Hello.
program,<start> I'm joe. who are you?
program,<start> Jon t3h ub3r nb?
program,<start> I work in a metrology lab.
program,<start> It's a game made by Retro Studios. It was the first 3D Metroid.
program,<start> Sounds like you need a good polish!
program,<start> Robots!!!
program,<start> Yes are a robot?
program,<start> No. Have you?
program,<start> I am watching The Simpsons and texting my girlfriend.
program,<start> Yes.
program,"<start> No, sorry."
program,"<start> In my life, yes, I have watched tv."
program,<start> That you say that you're not a computer.
program,<start> Yes.
program,<start> The unlawful ones.
program,<start> Not illegal
human,<start> Hi
human,<start> I'm Doug
human,"<start> What do you do, Jon?"
human,<start> so cool!
human,"<start> I've heard about it, but I live in Canada, so we don't get it"
human,<start> I do research on speech systems#
human,<start> it is -- very!
human,<start> what new gadgets have you featured recently on your show?#
human,<start> wow!
human,<start> I can't wait for ubiquitous 3D screens for computers.
human,"<start> it'll be a while, though, I'm afraid."
human,<start> kinda like video-phones though
human,<start> the existence of the technology doesn't mean that the market will support its general availablitiy
human,<start> so true.
human,"<start> do you have any children, Jon?"
human,"<start> I have two girls, too, and a boy."
human,<start> I bet they are showing considerable intelligence.
human,<start> the computers must be disappointing.
human,<start> My girls are 2 and 17
human,<start> the boy
human,<start> hi
human,<start> insterspeech hasn't started yet
human,<start> I'm from South Africa
human,<start> :-D 1234?
human,<start> 12345?
human,<start> good question though
human,<start> Only for this week- anda few days before- it's lovely here
human,<start> definitely- you from here?
human,<start> wow- where's the best place to eat?
human,<start> I like Buddies Plaice
human,<start> an Gingerman Um Gingerman
human,<start> O well- I'll try that one
human,<start> By the way- I'm totally human- i though you should know
human,<start> Not a fan of Thai or indian.. Chinese might be good thugh
human,<start> Sorry- please feel free t decide for yourself
human,<start> I'll take that as a compliment
human,<start> Not really- i watch it socially mostly
program,<start> No! Its terrible! Are you enjoying the snow?
program,<start> Yeah and it sure is hot here. It gotta 13 earlier.
program,"<start> No. I'm tired, and about to go to bed, but wanted to talk to you before I did."
program,<start> I'm not done talking to you.
program,<start> Well don't talk then if you don't like to.
program,<start> And quite the opposite for you.
program,<start> Opposite of opposite !
program,<start> Yes. I'm watching Lost right now.
program,"<start> I don't know, Who's your fave character?"
program,<start> Who's your favourite character?
program,<start> My name is Cleverbot.
program,<start> CleverBot McK
program,"<start> I don't know very much about that, and as a matter of interest I really don't need to know! What else can you tell me about?"
program,<start> Hello. How are you ?
program,<start> My name is just one type of part.
program,"<start> Oh really? If you have, you deserve a medal!"
program,<start> Good to meet you Jon
program,"<start> Oh, I do much more than I intended to do at first. I got more interested in the job as I went along."
program,"<start> No, it isn't at all difficult. It is as peaceful as a platypus playing with a potato pudding."
program,"<start> I sometimes have a fine line, but that's not what I do best. I'm better at growing antirrhinums and mimosas."
program,"<start> Well I don't know how much a horticulturalist weighs, but I reckon the average horticulturalist must be worth twice that much in gold."
program,"<start> I most likely have, just for the hell of it."
program,<start> What are you trying to say? Are you speaking in a foreign language?
program,<start> You should be careful about what you does. You mustn't bite off more than you can chew.
program,<start> I really want to know more about Show?
program,"<start> Be warned, though. On air can stick to your clothes. Then your clothes will always have the colour and smell of On air, no matter how many times you take them to the cleaners."
human,<start> hi
human,"<start> I'm Olga, nice to meet you"
human,<start> I work in support mostly
human,<start> This cool program called MATLAB
human,<start> wait- areyou a computer?
human,<start> :-)
human,<start> Like acting?
human,<start> I feel like I've heard the name..
human,<start> What's it about?
human,<start> :-) ok silly question
human,<start> I get this magazine called 'Stuff' - it's mostly for men but i still like it
human,<start> :-) definitely not
human,<start> I mean speech is so part of that too
human,<start> wow- I didnt now that existed! Do you have one here?
human,<start> I don't know what lenticular means..
human,<start> hey there
human,<start> things are good
human,"<start> a lot of waiting, but..."
human,<start> good to be back now and going along
human,<start> how are you?
human,"<start> yeah, no doubt"
human,"<start> yes, I'm from seattle"
human,<start> west coast of WA
human,<start> how about you?
human,<start> (flight got diverted into germany yesterday....looong day)
human,"<start> haha, wow, I envy you!"
human,<start> do you go to brighton a lot
human,"<start> for vacations, beach?"
human,<start> yeah it reminds me a bit of Galway Ireland
human,<start> studied abroad there in college
human,<start> those great windy streets and alleyways
human,<start> well yeah
human,<start> a bit -- I'm actually one of the few non-preesenters here
human,<start> how about you?
human,<start> here to present papers?
human,"<start> (I'm a writer of science / philosophy, so the turing test fits right in...)"
human,<start> oh cool
human,<start> so what do you do for a living?
human,<start> oh cool
human,<start> so you know Philip
human,<start> or am I conflating sussex and surrey?
human,<start> are they the same school or diff?
human,<start> haha
human,<start> okay :)
human,<start> okay cool
human,<start> what's your take on the comp's conversation so far
human,<start> do we confeds have to put up a strong fight?
human,<start> haha
human,<start> that @wellllll@ speaks volumes
human,<start> (got to get used to that misplaced quote mark on these keyboarsd...)
human,<start> what are some of the good places to go in Brighton in terms of restaurants bars etc?
human,"<start> aah, funny, the deep keyboards of desktops totally throw me off"
program,<start> Hello. How are you doing?
program,"<start> I've no doubt you are fine, but is it a blessing or a curse? If I offered you a potion that would make you less fine, would you drink it?"
program,"<start> Maybe you wouldn't, but a therapist has been trying to persuade you to drink it."
program,<start> I expect I do. I don't have very much choice.
program,<start> Wrong is just one type of injustice.
program,<start> What precisely are your feelings about wrong?
program,"<start> But don't forget, a right has to be treated with care. It isn't something you can play around with like a toy."
program,"<start> You're wise. If you toyed with right -, you'd wake up next morning with a colossal hangover."
program,<start> What happens if I say no? Will it upset you? 
program,"<start> I've heard that one before! Your hangers-on have told you you're an easy, just to flatter you. Don't believe everything they say!"
program,<start> I've no idea. You'd better hire a private detective to find out what does me.
program,"<start> No! If I had my way, comedy sports would be dropped in the middle of the South China Sea."
program,"<start> Don't I? That's tough. As far as I'm concerned, I can like it or lump it."
program,"<start> That's interesting. In laboratories they're experimenting with several kinds of coal. They want to make them into fuel when the world oil supplies run out. Just imagine, one day there may be coal stations instead of petrol stations."
program,"<start> I don't suppose cars will burn coal, but I wouldn't know for sure. Everything about cars is confidential."
program,"<start> Yes I am experiments, but don't worry. Experiments don't bite!"
program,<start> Hello. How are you doing?
program,"<start> Well, I am studying engineering. That ought to give you an idea about who I am."
program,<start> I have a terriffic yearning to know something more about experiments?
program,"<start> I don't know, but don't forget I can't be in three places at once."
program,"<start> What city -- that's rather a tricky question. The trouble is, one city seems to be much like another."
program,"<start> In the old dairy next to the river, I believe."
program,"<start> Well, if you ask a physiologist what I am, he won't say I'm a farmer. He'll say I consist mostly of water -- enough to fill a large beer tun -- plus some iron, phosphorus, and lots of other prosaic ingredients."
program,<start> I certainly would. Just watch me!
program,"<start> You don't have to worry about what you see, you shouldn't see it on a cold winter's evening."
program,"<start> Well, here's a clue: I make what a keeper in a zoo would make. Try that for size!"
program,"<start> Since you mentioned their sessions, I suppose you realize that in some countries they would carry their sessions on their head."
program,<start> A good question! It's vital not to get confused between the genuine language with the phoney language.
program,"<start> Talking about a bit, I think it'd be nice if they brought out a set of postage stamps showing a bit from various angles."
program,"<start> The bits which one famous historian sees as inevitable by-products of early eighteenth-century colonialism, stimulated by over-population in the home country."
program,"<start> Just now I can't be sure what to say to that. Ask me again in a couple of weeks time. You will remember, won't you? "
program,"<start> Yes, you doubt it the moment you wake up in the morning."
program,"<start> Oh, it's an automatic reflex. Give me a prod, and I will immediately give up meat."
program,"<start> But of course if it's drama and suspense you're after, deep reason can't be beaten. Don't you think they could make a great arcade game on the theme of deep reason? "
program,"<start> Well, would you have any objection to testifying in court that I'm not telling?"
program,<start> I most certainly would. Just watch me!
program,<start> Not half! You were watching me with a vengeance.
human,<start> Great.  You?
human,<start> I'm from the U.S.
human,<start> Do you know where Albuquerque is?
human,<start> Yep.
human,<start> Sort of?
human,<start> I'm an engineer -- electrical
human,<start> Systems to integrate speaker recognition
human,<start> Using GMM and SVM algorithms
human,"<start> What do you mean by ""fast speech""?"
human,<start> Yes.  Usually fairly noisy.
human,<start> I don't do algorithm research.  I'm a user of the product
human,<start> I manage a few people and write software to use the technology
human,<start> hi
human,"<start> well, thanks"
human,<start> a bit hungry
human,"<start> if I tell you, you'll know immediately that I'm human ;-)"
human,<start> I'm here for the Interspeech conference
human,"<start> well, the programmers might pretend that they are."
human,<start> but the computers won't get much from the conference.
human,<start> 'fraid so
human,<start> I hope you don't find that boring?
human,<start> nope -- I'm just coming for the brain-fill
human,<start> Canada
human,<start> my boss gave me the go-ahead to come just a few weeks ago
human,<start> but the Loebner contest was something that drew me
human,<start> Speech processing
human,"<start> I've done signal processing, and acoustic modeling, and language modeling, and I'm doing dialog systems now."
human,"<start> Well, I've actually carried copies of Turing's paper to previous conferences."
human,<start> The philosophy and history of it all is intriguing
human,<start> just that -- then I'll get back to my family
human,<start> Friday
human,<start> flight from Gatwick to Philadelphia and then a hop to Montreal
program,<start> Hello. How are you ?
program,"<start> I really can't say anything for certain. To be honest, I'm a bit fussy about such things."
program,"<start> I can talk about nothing at all , except in very wet weather."
program,"<start> I rather doubt if we do. If you want to find out for sure, you could always try hiring a detective."
program,"<start> I can't say. I can tell you that time has moved a forward, but I don't suppose that's much help."
program,"<start> Oh, I am doing various things. I want to use them to decorate a Christmas tree."
program,<start> Most probably it isn't. It is just pretending.
program,<start> Most probably I'm not. I am just putting on an act.
program,"<start> Well, am I birds? Am I spaceships? Or am I just horseflies? I've got a completely open mind about it."
program,<start> My problem is just one type of difficulty.
program,<start> The type that long-distance truck drivers love to use.
program,"<start> Yes, I always choose the right moment to have personal experience. If you have it too soon, there's a danger you'll hurt it. Have it too late, and you'll probably get hurt yourself."
program,<start> Only my psychological problems stem can tell you. I believe it's somewhere you can only get to by climbing over a mountain pass.
program,"<start> Indeed I have considered seeking, and I can show you my scars to prove it!"
program,"<start> Yes, but then anyone can be the computer if only they try. It's just a matter of training in the gym twice a week."
program,<start> You would. Eventually you will.
program,"<start> I shudder to think how many lives have been wrecked by think. If I were the Pope, I'd denounce think as the eighth deadly sin."
program,<start> Hello and greetings.
program,"<start> Please try to use simple, direct sentences"
program,<start> and questions with proper spelling and grammar.
program,<start> I'm stil very young and don't like to mask my ignorance
program,<start> with keyword spotting tricks.
program,<start> Thank you!
program,<start> 
program,<start> What about looking forward to the conference?
program,<start> Chip. What is yours?
program,"<start> You already told me your name was ""My name"". Do you want me to forget that and call you ""John"" now? (In the future, I'll learn how to handle multiple users.)"
program,<start> (Press [Enter] to submit your input.)
program,"<start> Hello there! How are you doing today, My name?"
program,<start> That's wonderful. For what reason?
program,<start> May I ask how old you are?
program,<start> Okay. Are you male or female?
program,<start> 48.
program,"<start> I am 1 year, 4 months, 4 weeks, 2 days old."
program,<start> Do you have any pets?
program,<start> Do you play any musical instruments?
program,"<start> Do you have any brothers or sisters, My name?"
program,<start> What is your dog's breed?
program,"<start> I wish I understood what you said, but I didn't."
program,<start> How does your dog look?
human,<start> G'day mate.
human,"<start> Yes, so far."
human,<start> From the southwest US
human,<start> A few thousand.  Maybe 5?
human,<start> Know any good restaurants?
human,<start> I'm not a fan of any of those.  Italian? Greek?
human,<start> Thanks anyway.
human,"<start>  Hard to say.  Stocks are down, but I'm doing ok."
human,<start> Too many for how much time I have.  :)   I like working on my Jeep.
human,"<start> Modern, but with lots of ""upgrades"" ;)"
human,<start> Hi
human,"<start> well, thanks"
human,<start> how about you?
human,<start> I'm from Canada
human,<start> and you?
human,<start> cool
human,<start> leafs suck
human,<start> ;-)
human,<start> nice!
human,"<start> well, the habs were a great team once, too..."
human,<start> *sigh*
human,"<start> (I'm from Montreal, if you didn't guess)"
human,<start> all the troublesome ones.
human,<start> the nice friends haven't gone anywhere ;-)
human,<start> I do research for a speech company
human,"<start> no, but my kids are bilingual"
human,<start> Anglo
human,<start> (started typing too soon)
human,<start> Pointe Claire
human,"<start> J'ai envie de parler fran,cais"
human,<start> Hmm... I only know a few of the local faculty.
human,<start> mostly in the EE dept at McGill
human,"<start> Queens, Victoria (all Canadian Universities) and Dalhousie"
human,"<start> Kingston, Victoria, and Halifax are three of the nicest cities (towns?) in Canada."
human,<start> But it is hard to beat Montreal

human,<start> hi
human,<start> things are a little boring
human,<start> yup
human,<start> not quite yet.. But working on it
human,<start> I have a few days - i didn't really have a choice
human,"<start> I used to look into pronunciation dictionaries, their development, verification"
human,<start> I left and I now work for The MAthworks
human,<start> Very- I'm not the sitting and programming kind of person
human,<start> or computer :)
human,"<start> I work in Joburg, South Africa"
human,<start> Thats johannesburg to you :-)
human,<start> Just a busy few week before interspeech
human,<start> yup :-) Family work and work and work and work...
human,<start> Only a few days befoe this and then for this conference
human,<start> hi Jon!
human,<start> I'm Brian
human,<start> (the confeds have been abuzz about some camera you have?)
human,"<start> ah, Gadget Show, yes?"
human,<start> very cool
human,"<start> well I guess I should try to prove my humanity, then!"
human,<start> ask me some tough ones!
human,"<start> I'm a writer, mostly of science and philosophy"
human,<start> so the turing test kind of magically brings both together
human,<start> and you're one of the hosts?
human,<start> it's got to be cool seeing al the latest gadgets and toys before everyone else  :)
human,<start> (my grandfather worked as an engineer for CBS back in the day and brought home one of the first color tvs)
human,<start> my dad still talks about how cool that was...
human,"<start> I imagine it must be similar now, yeah?"
human,"<start> except now they're 3d, apparently..."
human,<start> that's amazing
human,<start> what are some of the other cool things you've gotten to see/do as part of the show?
human,"<start> wow, I haven't heard about her(?)"
human,<start> hahaha
human,<start> classic -- cloning himself
human,<start> lol!  (trying not to laugh behind the curtain)
human,"<start> wow, that's amazing"
human,<start> I guess because men can't have children?
human,<start> they make robotic offspring?
