human,"Yeah, that's pretty appealing. There's one comic I like that updates on ""selected Mondays."" Very frustrating."
human,"Oh, definitely not. But very few webcomic artists can actually make a living doing webcomics - most of them have to keep a day job as well. That makes it hard for them tBut, of course, it's also hard to attract more viewers without a regular schedule. Something of a catch-22."
human,"Reading used to be one of my favorite things to do, but these days I am finding less and less time for it."
human,Quite. I'm not even sure why we put ourselves through all this busywork?
human,"True enough. Aristotle recommended moderation in all things, and I suppose busyness is no different."
human,"Of course, the tricky part is figuring out exactly how much counts as moderate. It tends to shift around."
human,"Well, let's abandon philosophy for now. Where do you see yourself in a year?"
human,Doing anything new?
human,"(haha, that's alright.)"
human,What goal do you refer to?
human,What sort of career would you consider rewarding?
