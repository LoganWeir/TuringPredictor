human,"<start> Yeah, that's pretty appealing. There's one comic I like that updates on ""selected Mondays."" Very frustrating."
human,"<start> Oh, definitely not. But very few webcomic artists can actually make a living doing webcomics - most of them ahv BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace have to keep a day job as well. That makes it hard for them tBut, of course, it's also hard to attract more viewers without a regular schedule. Something of catch-22.

human,"<start> Well, let's abandon philosophy for now. Where do you see yourself in a year?"

human,"<start> I'm surprised we're hosting this sort of thing here, actually."
human,<start> It just seems like something well- BackSpace  BackSpace -known enough that it would be at a more official venue.
human,<start> My fellow humans are giggling  BackSpace . It doesn't seem all that official. :-)
human,"<start> Perhaps not! Oneo BackSpace  of the points that separate us from the crude AIs is humor, after all."
human,"<start> Of course it can, but it is a difficult challenge.  BackSpace "
human,"<start> One of Heinlein's books said ""The BackSpace  BackSpace  BackSpace Humans BackSpace  is the animal that laughs."" So any computer that can pass the Turing test will have to be able to do that much."
human,<start> Sometimes!
human,"<start> Why did the chicken cross the road? To get a  BackSpace  BackSpace hit by a car< BackSpace , I guess? Shucks, I don't know. Ask the chicken."
human,<start> East Asian

human,<start> That's too bad.
program,"<start> When you do go out, are you a ritzy place or a fast-food kind of person?"
program,<start> You can spend a lot of money eating out like that.
program,<start> Do you have a favorite restauar BackSpace  BackSpace rant?
program,"<start> Do you wear glasses, have you had corrective eye surgery?"
program,<start> Unhealthy: what thin people call you when you are fat and fat people call you when you are thin.

program,"<start> Whta BackSpace  BackSpace at other medical style people do you consult? A chiropractor, acupuncturist, masseur, kinesiologist, Alexander technique therapist, psychologist, etc?"
program,<start> How many doctor hs BackSpace  BackSpace shows are there anymore?
program,<start> Why gets way too philosophical.
program,<start> The mdo BackSpace  BackSpace odern breakfast cereal diet is complete junk. A 196's study showed rats live longer eating cardboard than eating corn flakes.
program,<start> I have no idea.
program,<start> Of course I am human. Aren't we all?
program,<start> OK.
program,<start> Sorr BackSpace  BackSpace rry. I can't help you.

program,<start> What's one of your favorite movies?
program,"<start> While I learned a bunch of math ni BackSpace  BackSpace in college, I've never had a real use for anything more than high school math."
program,<start> Conversation is a great way to el BackSpace  BackSpace learn about people.
program,<start> I wish I knew.
program,"<start> Yes, it is."
program,<start> How old do you have to be to converse?
program,<start> I think five is the minimum age to have opinions. But few adults are og BackSpace  BackSpace going to care for those opinions.
program,<start> Are you sa BackSpace  BackSpace asking about some god creation myth or are you being more practical than that?
program,<start> Should you insist on always being yourself in conversation?
program,<start> Are you shopaholic or someone who hates shopping?
program,<start> I don't think so.
program,<start> I sometimes enoj BackSpace  BackSpace joy pretending I am a tour guide.
program,"<start> Domain Eukarya, kingdom Animalia, phylum Chordata, subphylum Vertgrata, class Mammalia, order Primates, family Homindidae, genus Homo, species Sapiens."

program,<start> Did you forget to say something?
program,"<start> Given air at the same temperature, where deo BackSpace  BackSpace oes an ice cube melt faster, Arizona or North Carolina."
program,<start> What else would yuo BackSpace  BackSpace ou expect from a young French woman?
program,<start> Ice melts faster in Nro BackSpace  BackSpace orth Carolina than Arizona because the air has a greater reservoir of molecules to transfer heat to - it is more humid in North Carolina so it has more water in the air.
program,<start> Have you ever wanted citizenship elsewhere?
program,<start> Who is  What?
