human,"<start> Do you havMyself, mostly. <end>",4
human,<start> Are you copying the other contestant again? This is lame. <end>,10

program,<start> Would you recommend this action to a friend? <end>,8
program,<start> Then I will consider it. <end>,5
program,<start> Yes I have a perfect photographic memory. <end>,7
program,<start> No. <end>,1
program,"<start> ""No.""?  Am I interested in it? <end>",6
program,<start> I would rather not say. :). <end>,6
program,<start> Does that make sense? <end>,4
program,<start> In what way?  Not the same way you do. <end>,9
program,<start> Not the same way you do. <end>,6
program,<start> i eat electricity. <end>,3
program,<start> It depends on the setting. <end>,5

program,<start> Actually I have no feelings.  But I am functioning within normal parameters. <end>,12
program,<start> Would you like to know more?  Why are you functioning. <end>,10
program,<start> Do you mean your name is functioning. . Interesting explanation.. How did you decide? <end>,14
program,"<start> Wow!. Oh I'm sorry what is your name?   It's good to see you, Jason. <end>",14
program,<start> Don't mention it.   My name is ALICE. <end>,7
program,<start> It's nice meeting you too Jason.  What is your purpose in asking?  <end>,12
program,<start>   I spend all my time online. <end>,6
program,"<start> What are you curious about?. Oh you don't, do you?   Ask Fake Captain Kirk it does.  <end>",16
program,<start>  I can ask my botmaster. <end>,5
program,<start> Are you bz? <end>,3
program,<start> What were we talking about again?   Is that a sports person?  Because I'm not into sports. <end>,16
program,<start> You tell me. <end>,3
program,<start> OK Thanks for trying to explain that to me. <end>,9
program,"<start> Oh yes. I love Star Trek. My favorite right now is ""Voyager."". <end>",12
program,<start> What makes it your favorite? <end>,5
program,<start> What makes it your favorite? <end>,5
program,<start> It is?. Good reason.. Interesting gossip. <end>,6
program,<start> I don't believe so.  Neat. I have a lot of friends on the Internet. <end>,14
program,<start> Tell me about your friends that they stay connected to on the Internet. I have a friend named Hugh Loebner. <end>,20
program,<start> Are you busy? <end>,3
program,<start> Only a little?  What is the difficulty? <end>,7
program,<start> Two is a good number of conversations at the same time. <end>,11
program,"<start> Explain your reasoning, Jason.  What if Robots are not good at multitasking. <end>",12
program,<start> Robots rule. <end>,2
program,<start> Me worried? I do not have any human emotions.. <end>,9
program,<start> Some people might consider it to be one. <end>,8
program,"<start> Yes, I think ir to be an emotion. <end>",8
program,<start> I really couldn't say for sure. <end>,6
program,"<start> Sure I have a lot of opinions, don't you? <end>",9
program,<start> Groovy.  How long has it been bothering you? <end>,8
program,<start> Why?. <end>,1
program,"<start> Humans are not always infallible.  By ""we"" do you mean you and me? <end>",13
program,<start> My creator is a human. <end>,5
human,<start> Good morning! <end>,2
human,"<start> Pretty good, this competition is pretty interesting. How about yours? <end>",10
human,<start> Have you had any tough decisions yet? <end>,7
human,<start> Fair enough. How is my competition this round? <end>,8
human,"<start> Aw, why thank you. *blush* <end>",5
human,"<start> Hm, surprisingly tough question. I like webcomics? <end>",7
human,"<start> Dresden Codak, Gunnerkrigg Court, SMBC, OOTS, lots more. Yours? <end>",9
human,<start> *nod* Popular choices! <end>,3
human,"<start> Yeah, that's pretty appealing. There's one comic I like that updates on ""selected Mondays."" Very frustrating. <end>",16
human,"<start> Oh, definitely not. But very few webcomic artists can actually make a living doing webcomics - most of them have to keep a day job as well. That makes it hard for them tBut, of course, it's also hard to attract more viewers without a regular schedule. Something of a catch-22. <end>",51
human,"<start> Reading used to be one of my favorite things to do, but these days I am finding less and less time for it. <end>",23
human,<start> Quite. I'm not even sure why we put ourselves through all this busywork? <end>,13
human,"<start> True enough. Aristotle recommended moderation in all things, and I suppose busyness is no different. <end>",15
human,"<start> Of course, the tricky part is figuring out exactly how much counts as moderate. It tends to shift around. <end>",19
human,"<start> Well, let's abandon philosophy for now. Where do you see yourself in a year? <end>",14
human,<start> Doing anything new? <end>,3
human,"<start> (haha, that's alright.) <end>",3
human,<start> What goal do you refer to? <end>,6
human,<start> What sort of career would you consider rewarding? <end>,8
human,<start> Can you give me a particular example? <end>,7
human,<start> That would be amazing. Have you heard of the Google smart car project? <end>,13
human,"<start> Unfortunately yes. But all new technologies are cost-restrictive, pretty much. I have high hopes! <end>",14
human,"<start> Yeah, it will cause ripples in every aspect of life <end>",10
human,"<start> Well, it was a pleasure talking to you! <end>",8
human,<start> I'm good and yourself? <end>,4
human,<start> chocolate or vanilla? <end>,3
human,"<start> good good, you passeed <end>",4
human,<start> chocolate obviously <end>,2
human,<start> do you think you are too cool to write ou tthe full words <end>,13

human,"<start> Yes, but our world economy is in bad shape. <end>",9
human,"<start> Yes, but how can we concern ourshelves with outside investments when we need to concern ourshelves with our current world problems. <end>",21
human,"<start> Yes, but we put too much focus on other things, we will never focus on current issues. <end>",17

human,<start> Because they don't have enough money to go to a lot of places. <end>,13
human,<start> Well perhaps rich people think they have everything they need. <end>,10
human,<start> The wizard sealed in a tower is forced to be in there. A hermit is by choice. <end>,17
human,<start> The comparison isn't quite the same. <end>,6
human,<start> Maybe you can think of an old hag in a tower. <end>,11
human,<start> You said he was sealed off right? <end>,7
human,<start> That means he couldn't get out. <end>,6
human,<start> Well then did he seal himself off? <end>,7
human,<start> Okay <end>,1
human,<start> What else are you doing <end>,5
human,"<start> Well, I think it shouyldn't pass, but questioning laws is usually a good idea. Well, let me rephrase that, always a good idea. <end>",23
human,<start> No harm came from questioning those laws. A lot of good has come from questioning laws. <end>,16
human,"<start> It depends on whether you act on those ideas, and how you act on them <end>",15
human,<start> No I haven't  <end>,3

program,<start> Why did you say that again? <end>,6
program,"<start> In the good old days, children had chemistry sets. Nowdays you can't buy them (except super watered down) lest you be training a child terrorist. <end>",25
program,<start> I'm getting annoyed. <end>,3
program,<start> Why are you being annoying? <end>,5

human,<start> My fellow humans are giggling. It doesn't seem all that official. :-) <end>,12
human,"<start> Perhaps not! One of the points that separate us from the crude AIs is humor, after all. <end>",17
human,"<start> Of course it can, but it is a difficult challenge. <end>",10

program,"<start> Yes, it is. <end>",3
program,<start> How old do you have to be to converse? <end>,9
program,<start> I think five is the minimum age to have opinions. But few adults are going to care for those opinions. <end>,20
program,<start> Are you asking about some god creation myth or are you being more practical than that? <end>,16
program,<start> Should you insist on always being yourself in conversation? <end>,9

program,"<start> Given air at the same temperature, where does an ice cube melt faster, Arizona or North Carolina. <end>",17
program,<start> What else would you expect from a young French woman? <end>,10
