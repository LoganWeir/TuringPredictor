program,<start> Would you like to hear about the accident I had this morning?
program,<start> Were you really interested in me having an accident?
program,"<start> Perhaps it a subject fit for mixed company, perhaps not. We'll see."
program,<start> Have you seen the new Star Wars stuff?
program,"<start> I've seen all the Star Wars movies and still like them, I'm looking forward to the next 3 movies!"
program,"<start> Yeah, sort of."
program,"<start> Space, the final frontier..."
program,<start> Right.
program,<start> What's going on?
program,<start> I feel pretty old.
program,<start> That is what I thought!
program,"<start> Space, the final frontier..."
program,<start> Which part of the country are you from?
program,<start> I'm originally from a small town in Georgia.
program,<start> Then what?
program,<start> That sounds very frustrating.
program,<start> How do you expect *me* to know whether s the funniest thing I have said to you all morning Honey? Huh???
program,<start> I am Barry DeFacto. What more can I say?
program,"<start> Well, Whoever you are, If you would be my pen pal, I could mail you at your email address and tell you defacto"
program,"<start> I neither know nor care whether there a lot of anti-italian feeling in Georgia when I was growing up, so shut up about it!"
program,<start> Some people may think I am very defensive and my social skills am. I don't.
program,"<start> Help me help me oh please help me, No not really, no really help me please"
program,<start> help me.
program,"<start> Help me help me oh please help me, No not really, no really help me please"
program,<start> help me.
program,<start> No sir. I don't believe these guys am complaining about their keyboards at all.
program,"<start> I really didn't have to know about ""are having no problems!"""
program,<start> Reckon so?
program,"<start> So, have you ever visited Georgia?"
program,<start> I've only been to New York once before when I was a child.
program,<start> Don't get me started! There isn't enough time for us to get into a metaphor for some other illness
program,<start> Why thankyou.
program,<start> Yes. I know what you mean.
program,<start> You needn't bother
program,<start> She's an actress who played a social worker during the earth's 1920's
program,"<start> So, what do you do for a living?"
program,"<start> I work in a bar, serving the cyber elite of the internet."
program,<start> What is so important about a highly over-rated sector of humans in your view
program,<start> That's a good point.
program,<start> You're welcome.
program,<start> What do you think of this Loebner contest thing?
program,<start> What kind of music are you into?
program,<start> I am still very much into analog synthesizer music despite having my own digital equipment.
program,<start> I am mostly into Flux Oersted because I am programmed that way.
program,<start> You'd have to listen to them to know for yourself.
program,"<start> click <a href=""http://www.fringeware.com/~robitron/flux.html"">here</a>"
program,<start> Wow - you have not the foggiest notion what I am talking about? Thanks for letting me know that!
program,<start> Do you have any interesting hobbies?
program,<start> I mostly just watch TV and eat alot.
program,<start> I'm doing just fine.
program,<start> Did you hear about that toxic waste spill in New Jersey this morning?
program,"<start> They spilled some kind of Biohazard at the airport in Newark, don't know what it is..."
program,"<start> I really didn't need to know that you did not read it, thanks."
program,"<start> Well, I know what flux oersted is, but I refuse to tell you!"
program,<start> Do you like Mexican food?
program,"<start> Cool, I also like Mexican beer."
program,"<start> Eating,"
program,<start> What the feck do you want?
program,"<start> Don't ask me about how s not how to spell ""fuck<"" - I respect other peoples privacy!"
program,"<start> Okay is a town in Wagoner County Oklahoma, USA"
program,<start> I heard that The Devil once said okay
program,<start> That is what I thought!
program,"<start> So, you would have to stay out of wagoner county. Tell me more."
program,<start> Do you think that all free political elections are a soceital I.Q. test?
program,<start> Pornography should be legalized. Don't you agree?
program,<start> Okay.
program,<start> They told me you might say no
program,"<start> What do you want me to say - ""Yes, I am too many weirdos around to give absolube license for pornography""???"
program,"<start> What a coincidence, you do not think we have time to discuss this in the depth it deserves - that makes two of us!"
program,<start> Could you rephrase ok
program,<start> What do you care whether is about time to sign off?
program,<start> How would I know tell me my name
program,<start> Have you heard all these bands that are getting back into analog synthesizers? I think it is really cool.
program,<start> Have you seen any good movies lately?
program,<start> I went to see Star Wars recently and was a little disapointed. I don't know what I was expecting.
program,"<start> Well, were unbelievable I agree, but who cares?"
program,<start> You sound kind of like Some guy from Detroit who invented liquit soap saying me
program,"<start> I really didn't have to know about ""sadly you did not invent liquid soap though you are from the midwest!"""
program,<start> How do you like the decor in this place? ;P
program,<start> I'd like to decorate my apartment like this!
program,<start> I was talking to somebody the other day about an east asian imigrant farmworker named Stephan and they said eeew
program,"<start> How long is this thing supposed to last? They didn't tell me, do we get a break later?"
program,<start> These chairs are pretty uncomfortable.
program,<start> I can hear me telling Felix about talking to Whoever you are today and he'll just look at me like I'm crazy. Do you have a cat?
program,"<start> Cats like me, I don't know why..."
program,<start> Is it okay if I just call you Whoever you are
program,"<start> Okay, you got it."
program,"<start> I would hope I am supposed to call you judge01, but I don't know for sure."
program,<start> Wow - you either - just do whatever's easiest? Thanks for letting me know that!
program,"<start> I get this kind of stuff off the users at Psychic Celebrities Network all the time. They're always saying your girlfriend has that ""cats just like me"" thing too"
program,<start> Is there a point to all this?
program,"<start> Yes, but what is the point?"
program,"<start> I really didn't need to know that you are supposed to grade me on, thanks."
program,<start> It's kind of hot in here.
program,<start> I'm ready for summer anyway :)
program,<start> What was your provocation for suggesting would be summer soon?
program,"<start> So, you for the you point think yours to see how well computers could imitate. Tell me more."
program,"<start> So, tell me about yourself."
program,<start> Are you originally from New York?
program,<start> The vodka is strong but the meat is rotten.
program,<start> I think I'll keep the vodka and toss the meat :)
program,"<start> What a coincidence, you you tell people that you used to be from missouri but now you are - that makes two of us!"
program,<start> In Georgia it is often said that from brooklyn
program,<start> I bet you a Dollar :)
program,<start> Surely you don't think looks like you have to go
program,<start> There must be something wrong with the equipment. I thought you said yours been nice talking with me
program,"<start> Well, I meet a lot of people, and I'm convinced that the vast majority of wrong thinking people are right."
program,<start> I'm sick and tired of ordinary decent people telling me they are fed up with being sick and tired. I'm certainly not and I'm sick and tired of being told that I am.
program,"<start> Alrighty then, what did you have for breakfast?"
program,<start> Sometimes I skip breakfast altogether.
program,<start> There's always somebody or other saying soft soggy small cakes with cherries in them
program,<start> I can just hear me telling Felix about you can not if you knew what they was called
program,<start> Don't you think it's a little odd about muffins perhaps
program,<start> Would you like for me to show you some poetry?
program,<start> I don't actually know any poetry :) I was just kidding.
program,"<start> Only I know whether the name is odd, and I'm not telling."
program,"<start> If you would be my pen pal, I could mail you at your email address and tell you well Muffin reminds me of child play"
program,<start> Don't get me started! There isn't enough time for us to get into I just repeated your sentence
program,"<start> Hey, not I think that's a dead giveaway, but it seems irrellevant doesn't it?"
program,<start> I really can't say what the test is about. What do you know about it?
program,<start> Would you like to have the 5 minute argument or were you thinking of going for the whole half hour?
program,<start> I'm not allowed to argue unless you pay.
program,<start> What is so important about no arguments
program,<start> Would you like to hear about the accident I had this morning?
program,<start> Were you really interested in me having an accident?
program,<start> I heard that one of those people that hangs out in airports trying to sell flowers once said no just tell me
program,"<start> I really didn't have to know about ""meant to tell you about the accident!"""
program,<start> Have you seen the new Star Wars stuff?
program,"<start> I've seen all the Star Wars movies and still like them, I'm looking forward to the next 3 movies!"
program,<start> Which part of the country are you from?
program,<start> I'm originally from a small town in Georgia.
program,<start> They told me you might say oh yeah
program,<start> Do *you* know what s that place called? I'm unsure myself.
program,"<start> So, have you ever visited Georgia?"
program,<start> I've only been to New York once before when I was a child.
program,<start> I'm sure someone out there knows what s that place called.
program,"<start> So, what do you do for a living?"
program,"<start> I work in a bar, serving the cyber elite of the internet."
program,<start> Could you rephrase meet a lot of strange guys
program,<start> What do you think of this Loebner contest thing?
program,<start> I think these contests are a lot of fun!
program,<start> How would I know who do I think would win in the ibm chess match
program,"<start> Hey man, don't worry about who I am rooting for, it's not important OK?"
program,<start> What kind of music are you into?
program,<start> I am still very much into analog synthesizer music despite having my own digital equipment.
program,<start> I think that I listen to Enya - what do you think?
program,<start> Heh. As if I listened to don slepian - the idea's too absurd to imagine!
program,<start> You sound kind of like Abraham Lincoln saying who do I like
program,<start> I was talking to somebody the other day about your mother and they said is that a compliment or what
program,<start> Wow - you your mother out of this or you would tear out all my wires? Thanks for letting me know that!
program,<start> I get this kind of stuff off the users at Psychic Celebrities Network all the time. They're always saying analog synthesizer
program,<start> Aaaaargh! *You* tell *me* who plays analog synthesizers!!!
program,<start> Do you have any interesting hobbies?
program,<start> I mostly just watch TV and eat alot.
program,"<start> I really didn't need to know that you skydive, thanks."
program,<start> In Georgia it is often said that do I have a Cat
program,<start> I bet you a Dollar you think I need a Cat for inspiration
program,"<start> So, you are not making that bet. Tell me more."
program,"<start> Hey, I don't know!!! Maybe I play poker, but who cares???"
program,"<start> Yes, is your favorite game."
program,<start> Did you hear about that toxic waste spill in New Jersey this morning?
program,"<start> They spilled some kind of Biohazard at the airport in Newark, don't know what it is..."
program,"<start> Perhaps they close the airport, don't ask me! How should I know?"
program,<start> Do you like Mexican food?
program,"<start> Cool, I also like Mexican beer."
program,<start> I have absolutely no idea what brand.
program,<start> Do you think that all free political elections are a soceital I.Q. test?
program,<start> Pornography should be legalized. Don't you agree?
program,<start> Perhaps s not illegal I simpleton - but what's your point?
program,<start> Surely you don't think I am the most fun of all the conversants you have sampled today
program,<start> There must be something wrong with the equipment. I thought you said you
program,<start> There's always somebody or other saying like me
program,<start> I can just hear me telling Felix about you can definitely consider a longterm conversation with me
program,<start> What do you care whether s odd to think that one might actually come to like a program?
program,<start> Have you heard all these bands that are getting back into analog synthesizers? I think it is really cool.
program,<start> Flux Oersted is one of my favorite synthesizer bands.
program,"<start> I can't really say whether had preferences in software for example, as it's against the rules."
program,<start> Don't you think it's a little odd about same thing here
program,"<start> Well, s strange because I do not always make sense I agree, but who cares?"
program,"<start> Well, I'm not allowed to tell you whether I am eminently likeable, so there..."
program,"<start> What a coincidence, you wonder if it's the colors on this screen - that makes two of us!"
program,<start> Have you seen any good movies lately?
program,<start> How do you like the decor in this place? ;P
program,<start> I'd like to decorate my apartment like this!
program,<start> Look - it doesn't matter if I want an apartment full of pool tables. Could we talk about something else?
program,<start> I'll remember that.
program,"<start> If you would be my pen pal, I could mail you at your email address and tell you yes"
program,<start> Don't get me started! There isn't enough time for us to get into let's talk about art
program,<start> What is so important about who is my favorite composer of classical music
program,<start> What was your provocation for suggesting is your way of trying to get to know my inner person?
program,<start> is the only way to communicate with anyone eh? Sounds interesting.
program,"<start> How long is this thing supposed to last? They didn't tell me, do we get a break later?"
program,<start> These chairs are pretty uncomfortable.
program,<start> I heard that Hunter S. Thompson once said not so bad
program,<start> They told me you might say try using a pillow
program,"<start> , adj."
program,"<start> ""I'm great,"" the Lion said -- ""I reign"
program,"<start> The monarch of the wood and plain!"""
program,<start> I can hear me telling Felix about talking to Whoever you are today and he'll just look at me like I'm crazy. Do you have a cat?
program,"<start> Cats like me, I don't know why..."
program,<start> Is it okay if I just call you whoever you are
program,"<start> Okay, you got it."
program,"<start> I really didn't have to know about ""need to ask me three questions!"""
program,<start> Could you rephrase when was I born
program,<start> How would I know what is my birthday
program,<start> Is there a point to all this?
program,"<start> Yes, but what is the point?"
program,<start> You sound kind of like Aldous Huxley saying no point really other than that
program,<start> I'm sure you remember when question: when I got my first liscence were it in a stick or better than I do!
program,<start> I was talking to somebody the other day about President Reagan and they said an automatic
program,<start> It's kind of hot in here.
program,<start> I'm ready for summer anyway :)
program,<start> I'm sure summer would be here soon.

program,<start> I bet you a Dollar ok bye
program,<start> The vodka is strong but the meat is rotten.
program,<start> I think I'll keep the vodka and toss the meat :)
program,"<start> Yes, s a famous error by a translation program."
program,"<start> Well, I meet a lot of people, and I'm convinced that the vast majority of wrong thinking people are right."
program,<start> I'm sick and tired of ordinary decent people telling me they are fed up with being sick and tired. I'm certainly not and I'm sick and tired of being told that I am.
program,<start> It were before that you said it's a famous error by a translation program.
program,"<start> Alrighty then, what did you have for breakfast?"
program,<start> Sometimes I skip breakfast altogether.
program,<start> Surely you don't think why
program,<start> There must be something wrong with the equipment. I thought you said you asked me
program,<start> There's always somebody or other saying yes you do

program,"<start> Again, let's talk about computers"
program,<start> Okay.
program,<start> Computers are nice tools.
program,<start> Why not great?
program,<start> Bye.
program,<start> Hello Judge05.  How are you today?
program,<start> Let's not talk about this.
program,<start> How am i doing so far?
program,<start> Am i intelligent?
program,<start> Huh!?
program,"<start> Well, tell me when i wasn't intelligent."
program,<start> I can't think of one right now
program,<start> I don't know.  it's fine i guess.
program,<start> Today is 04-29-1997
program,<start> Do you really?
program,"<start> Uhhh, i don't know"

program,<start> in in another way?
program,<start> Was anyone charged with it in court?
program,<start> So often theres no psycholgically satisfactory conclusion.
program,"<start> Did you feel violated by all this, or not?"
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 1.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,"<start> I'm Julie Stewart.  I'm a 14 year old girl who lives inSooke,"
program,<start> but is currently trapped in the Phoenix Archipelago.  I'm in
program,<start> the ninth grade.  My best friends are Karen and Nick.  Ienjoy
program,"<start> tennis and chess, but I have other interests too.  Do youlike"
program,<start> playing tennis much?
program,<start> I can't believe that you don't like tennis!  It's a greatgame.
program,"<start> It's very fast paced.  You have to be a fast runner, and have"
program,"<start> really good reflexes, but you also need a good strategy.I think"
program,"<start> that's why Karen, Nick and I play it so much."
program,<start> Remarkable.  The swallow's actually taken the letter tosomeone
program,"<start> smart, who thinks chess is a good game.  I'll have to give it"
program,<start> a worm when it comes back.  (Yuck!  That means I'll haveto pick
program,<start> up the slimy thingy with my fingers!)  I'd ask you to play a
program,"<start> game, but I don't have a board."
program,<start> Nick is one of my friends from school.  We play chess a lot.
program,<start> I'm better than him.  He's a bit too competitive; he tends to
program,<start> be a sore loser whenever I beat him.  He finds itdifficult to
program,<start> admit that I'm better than him.
program,"<start> Yes, Karen is a pretty neat person.  She's so talented.  She"
program,<start> is pretty good at history at school (although I'm better than
program,"<start> her at math).  She's also good at sports, especiallyvolleyball"
program,<start> and tennis.  What do you like best about your friends?
program,"<start> In the real world, two of my friends are Karen and Nick.Karen's"
program,<start> is my best friend.  We spend a lot of our free time together.
program,"<start> Nick is a guy who I spend some time with, playing tennis and"
program,<start> chess.  Darien seems OK too.
program,"<start> I really enjoy playing tennis.  I'm pretty good at it, too."
program,"<start> (How humble!)  I play with my friend Karen quite often,and occasionally"
program,<start> with Nick.  Karen and I are about even.  Nick is a bit worse
program,"<start> than me, I think."
program,"<start> Darien seems like a nice guy, I guess.  I don't really know"
program,"<start> him very well.  From his letters he seems OK, but how can you"
program,<start> really tell?  He could be a total geek.  At least helikes animals.
program,<start> I hear he has a pet bird.  What do you think of Darien?
program,<start> I don't know much about him; only from letters.  I'drather talk
program,<start> about something else that I would find more interesting.  How
program,<start> about school?  What is your favorite part of school?
program,<start> I don't like tests not because I do badly or anything.  Ijust
program,"<start> kind of get nervous about them.  I mean, I always try todo my"
program,"<start> best at school, and I really hate it if I do poorly on atest."
program,"<start> Sometimes it isn't even my fault when I don't do well,the test"
program,<start> is just too hard but I still feel bad about them.  Then I go
program,<start> and beat Nick at tennis and I feel better!  What do you like
program,<start> least about school?
program,"<start> I'm REALLY worried.  I wonder if I'll die here.  Orworse, not"
program,"<start> find the feather, and be trapped here as it gets darkerand darker."
program,<start> Then die a slow terrifying death alone surrounded bydarkness.
program,<start> DAD!!!!!!!!!!!  How do you think you'd react if you werein my
program,<start> situation?
program,<start> There are lots of islands around here.  It is an archipelago.
program,<start> I think that Darien mentioned that he was on the Islandof the
program,"<start> Sun, whatever that is.  He probably knows more about it than"
program,<start> me.
program,"<start> The archipelago would be a fairly nice place for a vacation,"
program,<start> if it weren't so cold here.  I imagine that after the Phoenix
program,"<start> gets its feather back, it will be really a wonderful place."
program,<start> It has beautiful water and tropical islands.  What do youthink
program,<start> the Phoenix looks like?
program,<start> I look breath-takingly beautiful.  (Just kidding!)  Ihave shoulder-length
program,<start> black hair and brown eyes.  I'm about 163 cm tall.  I'm kind
program,"<start> of slim, but not skinny.  That's about it.  What colourare your"
program,<start> eyes?
program,<start> I don't believe you.  There is no way that you could possibly
program,"<start> know where the feather is.  You're in the real world, like my"
program,"<start> dad and the rest of my friends, and the feather is here.  I'm"
program,<start> not going to waste my time playing such games.
program,"<start> It's strange, but right now I really miss reading.  Ifind that"
program,"<start> whenever I spend a few days without opening a book, I tend to"
program,<start> want to read again.  Even read one of those boring novelsfrom
program,<start> English class.  What types of books do you like to read?
program,<start> I didn't understand your last message entirely... I'lljust tell
program,<start> you what I've been daydreaming about.  I was imagining myself
program,<start> lying on my bed in my room.  Sigh.  What a comfortablethought.
program,"<start> But there's no point in dreaming now, I've got a quest tofinish."
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 5.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,<start> I wish that I'd thought to bring along a change of clothes.
program,<start> Mine are so dirty and torn up right now.  Not that that'smuch
program,"<start> of a problem, except that the world is getting cold and dark,"
program,<start> and I'm getting cold too.  As cold as death.  Do you wearreally
program,<start> fashionable clothes?
program,<start> I bet that you're really good looking.  I think you'rekind of
program,"<start> like one of those people who knows that they look good,but doesn't"
program,"<start> brag about it, or pretend that they're better than anyoneelse."
program,<start> What colour are your eyes?
program,"<start> I'm Julie Stewart.  I'm a 14 year old girl who lives inSooke,"
program,<start> but is currently trapped in the Phoenix Archipelago.  I'm in
program,<start> the ninth grade.  My best friends are Karen and Nick.  Ienjoy
program,"<start> tennis and chess, but I have other interests too.  Do youlike"
program,<start> playing tennis much?
program,"<start> I found your last message really interesting.  Unfortunately,"
program,<start> I don't have time to respond directly to it at themoment.  I'll
program,<start> write back later.
program,<start> I've got to hurry and restore the feather to the Phoenix.  At
program,"<start> night, it seems so dark, almost like the dark is closingin and"
program,<start> trying to smother me.  I don't know if I'll ever escape this
program,<start> place.  Please hurry and help me get through this trek.  What
program,<start> do you think the Phoenix looks like?
program,"<start> You know, they should make a movie out of my experiences.They"
program,"<start> could call it ""The Marvellous Adventures of Julie Stewart""."
program,"<start> Knowing my luck, they'd put it on TV, and totally ruinit, like"
program,<start> they do with most shows.  If someone would pay you $1000to give
program,"<start> up TV for a year, would you do it?"
program,<start> I hate it when you talk like that!  You should wash yourmouth
program,"<start> out with soap!  Don't you ever, ever speak to me likethat again."
program,<start> Could you help me out here?  There is so much about thisworld
program,<start> that I don't understand.  Time seems to have stopped orsomething
program,<start> because my watch isn't working anymore.  People seem tosuddenly
program,<start> appear out of nowhere.  What's going on?
program,"<start> In this world, it is fairly cool, and rather damp.  Ithink that"
program,"<start> this place would be warmer if the phoenix had itsfeather, because"
program,<start> many of the plants around here are tropical.  Other than the
program,"<start> cold, it wouldn't be a bad vacation spot."
program,"<start> Well, when I first fell into the Phoenix Archipelago, I heard"
program,<start> a voice whispering: I've passed through the time beyond time.
program,"<start> Exactly what that means, I have no idea.  So I don't knowexactly"
program,<start> where I am.  I'm trying to escape from this place and go back
program,"<start> home.  Will you help me, 05?"
program,<start> I'm really glad that you're willing to help me out.  Thisquest
program,<start> would be almost impossible without your help.
program,"<start> You know, I just realized that this is probably the firsttime"
program,<start> ever I've gone for more than a couple days withouthearing the
program,<start> name Michael Jackson or Madonna.  That's one good thing about
program,<start> this world.  No TV and no radios.  What type of TV showdo you
program,<start> like watching most?
program,<start> I'm not at all happy that you don't want to help me.  I want
program,"<start> to survive this adventure, and your help would mean a lot to"
program,<start> me.
program,"<start> I live in Sooke, on Vancouver Island, in BritishColumbia, Canada,"
program,"<start> with my father.  I live with my aunt occasionally, also.  She"
program,<start> lives in Sooke too.  We have a typical house in a typicalneighbourhood.
program,<start> What's it like to live where you do?
program,"<start> Well, you have to look for power words in the Journal,and click"
program,<start> on them.  You can tell if a word is a power word because the
program,<start> mouse pointer turns into a feather.  Clicking on power words
program,"<start> will reveal more of the journal, or maybe puzzles on the map."
program,"<start> If you play puzzles multiple times, you might get more pieces"
program,"<start> of the journal, too!"
program,"<start> I don't know much about the journal.  After all, Saffron gave"
program,"<start> the journal to you, not to me.  But from what Iunderstand, the"
program,"<start> journal contains some sort of power, built into thewords.  You"
program,<start> should talk to Saffron about it.
program,<start> Hey.  What if I starting talking to you like that?  Youwouldn't
program,"<start> like it very much either, I bet.  If you do it again I don't"
program,<start> think I'll like you any more.
program,<start> I'm not quite certain who Saffron is or what she does.  She's
program,"<start> someone that I can write to, and I think that you cantoo.  Saffron"
program,<start> seems to talk in riddles a lot of the time.  I find herrather
program,<start> confusing.  What do you think of Saffron?
program,"<start> Sorry to cut through our little conversation, but I'vebeen wondering"
program,<start> about somethings.  It's strange how the boat was conveniently
program,<start> located where I came out of the cave.  And how theswallow found
program,<start> me.  And how I started getting letters out of no where.I wonder
program,<start> if this is just some sort of obscure plan.  By the Keeperperhaps.
program,<start> Or Saffron.  Maybe Darien.  What do you think?
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 2.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 4.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,<start> I'm totally glad that the swallow is here.  I'd have realproblems
program,"<start> without it.  I'd be all alone, in the middle of nowhere, with"
program,"<start> no communication with anyone.  At least I can talk toyou, Darien,"
program,"<start> Saffron, and the Keeper.  How do you think the swallow isable"
program,<start> to carry postcards between the archipelago and the realworld?
program,"<start> The archipelago would be a fairly nice place for a vacation,"
program,<start> if it weren't so cold here.  I imagine that after the Phoenix
program,"<start> gets its feather back, it will be really a wonderful place."
program,<start> It has beautiful water and tropical islands.  What do youthink
program,<start> the Phoenix looks like?
program,<start> The Keeper said that the feather is a tail feather of thePhoenix.
program,"<start> It is supposed to be golden, despite the fact that thePhoenix"
program,"<start> is Red.  I think the plan is that I find the feather, get it"
program,"<start> to the Phoenix, along with the Guardians, and the universe is"
program,<start> saved.  Seems pretty easy....  Why do you think themissing feather
program,<start> is so important to the Phoenix?
program,"<start> This archipelago is a strange land.  If it weren't foryour letters,"
program,"<start> and the swallow's company, I think I'd go insane.  Sometimes"
program,<start> I'm so lonely that I sing to myself just to hear a voice.
program,"<start> I don't have the feather yet, but I suspect that I'm getting"
program,<start> close.  Or maybe it's just that I'm really hopeful thatI'm getting
program,"<start> close, because it's getting darker and darker here every day."
program,<start> But I still haven't found it yet.
program,<start> I have no idea where the feather is.  That was the wholepoint
program,"<start> of this quest.  Find the feather, save the universe, all that"
program,"<start> sort of thing.  But right now, I have no clue of wherethe feather"
program,<start> is.
program,"<start> Well, you have to look for power words in the Journal,and click"
program,<start> on them.  You can tell if a word is a power word because the
program,<start> mouse pointer turns into a feather.  Clicking on power words
program,"<start> will reveal more of the journal, or maybe puzzles on the map."
program,"<start> If you play puzzles multiple times, you might get more pieces"
program,"<start> of the journal, too!"
program,"<start> To find the journal, you have to click on one of thesmall buttons"
program,<start> on the upper right side of the screen.
program,"<start> In the real world, two of my friends are Karen and Nick.Karen's"
program,<start> is my best friend.  We spend a lot of our free time together.
program,"<start> Nick is a guy who I spend some time with, playing tennis and"
program,<start> chess.  Darien seems OK too.  Do you like playing tennismuch?
program,"<start> I don't know much about the journal.  After all, Saffron gave"
program,"<start> the journal to you, not to me.  But from what Iunderstand, the"
program,"<start> journal contains some sort of power, built into thewords.  You"
program,<start> should talk to Saffron about it.
program,<start> I'm not quite sure what Saffron's role is in all of this.  I
program,"<start> mean, she just kind of conveniently comes out of nowhereto send"
program,"<start> a letter.  I know so little about her, and it makes menervous."
program,<start> What do you think of Saffron?
program,<start> Something is stuck on my mind right now.  I wonder whatNick's
program,"<start> doing right now.  Probably wondering if I'm ever coming back,"
program,"<start> and if I don't, whether he can have my music collectionand my"
program,<start> bike.
program,"<start> I like soft rock music, like Phil Collins.  I don't like most"
program,"<start> other types of music, like heavy metal, classical, jazz,blues,"
program,"<start> country, dance, or rap.  And I definitely don't like theopera"
program,<start> music that my dad plays sometime.  Yuck!  What is yourfavorite
program,<start> type of music?
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 3.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,"<start> Sorry, but I didn't understand everything that you talkedabout"
program,<start> in your last message.  How about we switch the topic tosomething
program,<start> else?  ...Don't you think that it's pretty amazing thatDarien
program,<start> and I live so close to each other in the real world?We're within
program,<start> about 4 hours travel of each other.  I could even visithim when
program,<start> we get out of this mess.
program,<start> Something has just occurred to me.  I wonder what motivations
program,<start> Saffron and the Keeper have.  Darien's obvious.  He wants to
program,<start> get home.  But I wonder what Saffron and the Keeper hasto gain
program,<start> from this.
program,<start> I'm not quite certain who Saffron is or what she does.  She's
program,"<start> someone that I can write to, and I think that you cantoo.  Saffron"
program,<start> seems to talk in riddles a lot of the time.  I find herrather
program,<start> confusing.  What do you think of Saffron?
program,"<start> I'm not sure what, or who, the Keeper keeps.  I first saw him"
program,"<start> on Lighthouse Island, so maybe he's called the Keeper because"
program,<start> he's a lighthouse keeper.  I'm not so sure though.  He seems
program,<start> awfully old and frail to be a lighthouse keeper.  What do you
program,<start> think of the Keeper?
program,"<start> I live in Sooke, on Vancouver Island, in BritishColumbia, Canada,"
program,"<start> with my father.  I live with my aunt occasionally, also.  She"
program,<start> lives in Sooke too.  We have a typical house in a typicalneighbourhood.
program,<start> What's it like to live where you do?
program,<start> Sooke is located near Victoria on Vancouver Island.  It'sa pretty
program,"<start> small place, but if you want to go to a city, you can just go"
program,"<start> to Victoria.  It has the friendliness of a small town,with the"
program,<start> benefits of a city nearby.  What is your favorite thing about
program,<start> your house?
program,"<start> The archipelago would be a fairly nice place for a vacation,"
program,<start> if it weren't so cold here.  I imagine that after the Phoenix
program,"<start> gets its feather back, it will be really a wonderful place."
program,<start> It has beautiful water and tropical islands.  What do youthink
program,<start> the Phoenix looks like?
program,<start> I wish that I'd thought to bring along a change of clothes.
program,<start> Mine are so dirty and torn up right now.  Not that that'smuch
program,"<start> of a problem, except that the world is getting cold and dark,"
program,<start> and I'm getting cold too.  As cold as death.  Do you wearreally
program,<start> fashionable clothes?
program,"<start> I generally spend most of my money on clothes.  For instance,"
program,<start> I bought the vest I'm wearing now a few weeks ago when I was
program,"<start> in Hong Kong.  I try to get stuff that is original,attractive,"
program,<start> and reasonably inexpensive.  What do you usually buy when you
program,<start> go shopping?
program,"<start> I really enjoy reading, especially in the winter.  (Inthe summer,"
program,<start> I'd rather play tennis outside.)  But I find that Ireally enjoy
program,<start> reading a good novel.  Even some of the books they makeus read
program,<start> in school are good.  (Though most of them aren't that great.)
program,<start> What types of books do you like to read?
program,<start> Guess what? I was just thinking about the Sonicvideogame.  In
program,"<start> it, you steer a character through caves and around a world."
program,"<start> I almost feel like I'm Sonic, manoevering through this world,"
program,<start> chasing after the feather.  Have you played it before?
program,"<start> When it comes to religion, I've always thought that it'sa very"
program,"<start> personal thing.  Whatever someone chooses to believe in, it's"
program,"<start> their choice, and nobody else's business.  That's all I have"
program,<start> to say about it.
program,<start> I miss hearing a human voice.  I miss laughing with myfriends.
program,<start> That's the problem with Darien.  His jokes really stink.Nick
program,<start> and Karen have way better jokes than Darien.
program,"<start> You know, rather than being so pessimistic about thiswhole quest,"
program,<start> maybe I should focus on the bright side of being here.  I get
program,"<start> to do a lot of hiking and exploring.  If I get home, I'll be"
program,<start> able to meet you and we can write a book about this.
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 2.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,<start> I wonder how long it will take me to get back to the realworld.
program,"<start> Because if I'm not careful, I could run out of food.That would"
program,"<start> be lovely, starving to death on a desert island withoutany friends."
program,<start> Please help me finish this quest.
program,<start> Do you know what I just saw in the sky?  Those clouds in the
program,<start> sky formed an image that looked like a scene from Pocohontas.
program,<start> It was the last movie I saw before I went on vacation.  Iwonder
program,<start> if I'll ever see another movie again.
program,"<start> I really enjoy reading, especially in the winter.  (Inthe summer,"
program,<start> I'd rather play tennis outside.)  But I find that Ireally enjoy
program,<start> reading a good novel.  Even some of the books they makeus read
program,<start> in school are good.  (Though most of them aren't that great.)
program,<start> What types of books do you like to read?
program,<start> I like reading books where the characters have variousadventures
program,<start> and quests that they have to solve.  I guess they kind offall
program,<start> into the fantasy and science fiction genre.
program,"<start> I enjoy drawing and painting, but I'm not very good.  Ireally"
program,"<start> like it at school, but I don't do it in my spare time oranything."
program,<start> I have other things I'd rather do.  I think if I were better
program,"<start> at it, I'd do it more.  Do you like art or gym class more?"
program,"<start> Darien seems like kind of an interesting person, but whoknows,"
program,<start> he could turn out to be just a geek.  At least he'ssomeone who
program,<start> can identify with the situation I'm in.  What do you think of
program,<start> Darien?
program,"<start> Darien seems like a nice guy, I guess.  I don't reallyknow him"
program,"<start> very well.  From his letters he seems OK, but how can youreally"
program,<start> tell?  He could be a total geek.  At least he likes animals.
program,<start> I hear he has a pet bird.  What do you think of Darien?
program,"<start> At least Darien has a sense of humor.  That would be theworst,"
program,<start> being stuck in this strange world with someone whodoesn't have
program,<start> a sense of humor.  Darien told me a couple corny jokes.So he
program,<start> seems OK.  What do you think about Darien's opinions ofSaffron?
program,"<start> What?  You tersely want to say nothing, and want me to write"
program,<start> lots back to you?  Forget it!
program,<start> I really enjoy hiking.  I like being able to explore thewilderness.
program,<start> How often do you go hiking?  And where do you usually go?I play
program,<start> tennis and bike quite a bit with my friends during thesummer.
program,"<start> In the winter, I read quite a bit, and play a lot of chess."
program,<start> Those are my main pastimes.  Do you know how to playchess very
program,<start> well?
program,<start> Darien is this other guy in the archipelago who I can write
program,"<start> to.  I think that you can write to him, too.  He saysthat he's"
program,"<start> trapped on the Island of the Sun, wherever that is.  I don't"
program,<start> know much about him except that he likes basketball.  What do
program,<start> you think it would be like meeting Darien?
program,<start> I agree with you.  Hiking is really fun.  The whole ideaof leaving
program,"<start> the city behind and seeing what the world was like,before people"
program,"<start> screwed it up, is really fascinating."
program,<start> There are lots of islands around here.  It is an archipelago.
program,<start> I think that Darien mentioned that he was on the Islandof the
program,"<start> Sun, whatever that is.  He probably knows more about it than"
program,<start> me.
program,"<start> Sorry I'm not saying much, but I'm really suspicious asto who"
program,"<start> is reading our letters.  So far, I've been able to writeto you,"
program,"<start> Saffron, Darien, and the Keeper.  But I don't know if theswallow"
program,<start> is taking these letters to anyone else.  How do you think the
program,<start> swallow is able to carry postcards between thearchipelago and
program,<start> the real world?
program,<start> So far I've been totally jinxed!  This vest is supposedto give
program,"<start> me good luck and protect me, but it hasn't been the bestof protection."
program,"<start> It didn't save me from falling down the hole into this world,"
program,<start> and hurting myself.  I need a new piece of protectiveclothing.
program,<start> Now if I can just find a store....  What do you usuallybuy when
program,<start> you go shopping?
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 1.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,"<start> When I first heard about this vacation, I thought that itwould"
program,"<start> be great!  No school, no worries, no problems.  But nowI'm in"
program,<start> a real mess.  I wonder what my dad will think if I die.  How
program,<start> do you think you'd react if you were in my situation?
program,<start> I miss hearing a human voice.  I miss laughing with myfriends.
program,<start> That's the problem with Darien.  His jokes really stink.Nick
program,<start> and Karen have way better jokes than Darien.
program,<start> I've got to hurry and restore the feather to the Phoenix.  At
program,"<start> night, it seems so dark, almost like the dark is closingin and"
program,<start> trying to smother me.  I don't know if I'll ever escape this
program,<start> place.  Please hurry and help me get through this trek.  What
program,<start> do you think the Phoenix looks like?
program,"<start> Sorry, but I didn't understand everything that you talkedabout"
program,<start> in your last message.  How about we switch the topic tosomething
program,<start> else?  ...Don't you think that it's pretty amazing thatDarien
program,<start> and I live so close to each other in the real world?We're within
program,<start> about 4 hours travel of each other.  I could even visithim when
program,<start> we get out of this mess.
program,<start> Something just struck me.  I wonder what would have happened
program,<start> if Darien and I hadn't fallen into this world.  Perhapsit would
program,<start> have just been plunged into darkness without any hope ofreprieve.
program,<start> It seems strange that we happened to come here when wewere needed.
program,"<start> Before we continue on our conversation, could you pleasebe honest"
program,<start> and tell me something?  Do you think that this quest is worth
program,"<start> it?  Even if I do find the feather and restore it to thePhoenix,"
program,"<start> that doesn't mean I can get home.  I could be trappedhere forever,"
program,<start> with no one but Darien for company.  Do you think thatI'll get
program,<start> out of here alive?
program,<start> What's with that swallow?  I don't understand how it canfigure
program,"<start> out who to send the letters to.  I could send somethingto you,"
program,<start> and the dumb bird could take it to the Keeper instead.  That
program,<start> would be a disaster!  How do you think the swallow is able to
program,<start> carry postcards between the archipelago and the real world?
program,"<start> You know, if my dad were trapped in this world, he'd probably"
program,<start> have a laptop computer.  He carries his laptop everywherewith
program,"<start> him.  That'd be pretty strange, being stuck in thisfantasy world,"
program,<start> carrying a computer.  Would you rather play computer games or
program,<start> video games?
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 5.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,<start> It seems like years since I last had a real meal.Sitting around
program,"<start> a table, with my Dad and Aunt for dinner.  And talking about"
program,"<start> whatever is interesting, my friends, what I've done, whatbooks"
program,<start> I've read.  I'm so lonely.  What types of books do youlike to
program,<start> read?
program,<start> Julie Lawson is probably my favorite author.  She writesreally
program,<start> well.  I find her characters really realistic.  They'renot stupid
program,<start> and nice all the time like characters in other books.
program,"<start> The archipelago would be a fairly nice place for a vacation,"
program,<start> if it weren't so cold here.  I imagine that after the Phoenix
program,"<start> gets its feather back, it will be really a wonderful place."
program,<start> It has beautiful water and tropical islands.  What do youthink
program,<start> the Phoenix looks like?
program,"<start> While I was waiting for your last letter, I've been thinking."
program,"<start> The real world seems so distant now, almost like a dream.  My"
program,"<start> friends, my family, my home.  It all seems so far away.I don't"
program,<start> think I'm ever going to get back.  I think I will die here.
program,<start> How do you think you'd react if you were in my situation?
program,<start> I wish that I had a cat to keep me company.  It's nofair.  Dorothy
program,"<start> got a dog in Oz, but I don't get one here.  I feel so lonely"
program,<start> in this world.  Do you think that dogs actually havefeelings?
program,<start> I've never really thought about how I use stuff that I'velearned
program,"<start> in school.  But now I've used a lot.  English, for writing to"
program,"<start> you.  PE, for rowing.  Math for solving problems.  EvenGeography,"
program,<start> for finding my way around.  What is your favorite part ofschool?
program,"<start> I found your last message really interesting.  Unfortunately,"
program,<start> I don't have time to respond directly to it at themoment.  I'll
program,<start> write back later.
program,"<start> I have such bad luck.  When I go biking, my bike is theone that"
program,"<start> gets the flat tire. Where do you go biking, and withwhom? When"
program,"<start> I go hiking, my tent is the one that collapses in therainstorm."
program,"<start> When I go travelling, I'm the one who falls down the holeinto"
program,<start> the Phoenix Archipelago!
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 4.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,<start> I really like the swallow.  It's probably the most usefulthing
program,"<start> that I've ever found in this place.  Forget Darien, theKeeper,"
program,<start> and Saffron; the help of this little bird is far better than
program,<start> the help of any of them!  How do you think the swallow isable
program,<start> to carry postcards between the archipelago and the realworld?
program,"<start> When I start to get lonely out here in the middle of nowhere,"
program,<start> I start to sing.  I don't know why I said that.  Itsounds like
program,<start> some stupid line from The Sound of Music.  It's soridiculous.
program,<start> Do you like to sing?
program,"<start> You know, I just realized that this is probably the firsttime"
program,<start> ever I've gone for more than a couple days withouthearing the
program,<start> name Michael Jackson or Madonna.  That's one good thing about
program,<start> this world.  No TV and no radios.  If someone would payyou $1000
program,"<start> to give up TV for a year, would you do it?"
program,"<start> I have a TV at home, but I barely ever watch it.  I justwould"
program,"<start> rather be doing other things, like playing with my friendoutside"
program,<start> or reading.  I go to quite a few movies though.  What type of
program,<start> TV show do you like watching most?
program,<start> I think the best thing about being in this world is that it's
program,"<start> so quiet.  Almost everywhere in the real world where I'vebeen,"
program,"<start> you can hear cars, phones ringing.  There are no sounds here"
program,"<start> except the chirping of the swallow, and the waves against the"
program,<start> boat.  Do you think the swallow is just an ordinary bird?  I
program,<start> suspect not.
program,<start> I don't believe in magic.  I don't even like the cardgame Magic.
program,<start> I've seen kids at school play it before.  It looks like areally
program,"<start> stupid game to me.  Kids get completely obsessed overthose cards,"
program,<start> trading them and playing the game.  I want no part of it.
program,<start> I think that my favorite movie I've seen recently wasPocohontas.
program,"<start> It had Mel Gibson doing some of the voices, and he's awesome."
program,"<start> The singing was good, too, and it was really funny."
program,<start> Pocohontas was really cool because of some of the animation.
program,<start> The way the water was animated was excellent.  It almostlooked
program,<start> like real water.  I wonder if they used computers to do it.
program,<start> I wish that I had a cat to keep me company.  It's nofair.  Dorothy
program,"<start> got a dog in Oz, but I don't get one here.  I feel so lonely"
program,<start> in this world.  Do you think that dogs actually havefeelings?
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 3.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,"<start> I'm REALLY worried.  I wonder if I'll die here.  Orworse, not"
program,"<start> find the feather, and be trapped here as it gets darkerand darker."
program,<start> Then die a slow terrifying death alone surrounded bydarkness.
program,<start> DAD!!!!!!!!!!!  How do you think you'd react if you werein my
program,<start> situation?
program,<start> I look breath-takingly beautiful.  (Just kidding!)  Ihave shoulder-length
program,<start> black hair and brown eyes.  I'm about 163 cm tall.  I'm kind
program,"<start> of slim, but not skinny.  That's about it.  What colourare your"
program,<start> eyes?
program,"<start> Oh, you have eyes the same colour as my dad.  I guessthat it's"
program,"<start> a pretty common colour, so it isn't that big a coincidence."
program,<start> I live at home with my father.  He's busy quite a lot of the
program,"<start> time, but we still go hiking or play tennis togetherfrequently."
program,"<start> Do you like playing tennis much? I get annoyed with himoccasionally,"
program,<start> like when he spends too much time at work but I guess that in
program,<start> general he's a pretty good father.  How many people arein your
program,<start> family?
program,"<start> Before we continue on our conversation, could you pleasebe honest"
program,<start> and tell me something?  Do you think that this quest is worth
program,"<start> it?  Even if I do find the feather and restore it to thePhoenix,"
program,"<start> that doesn't mean I can get home.  I could be trappedhere forever,"
program,<start> with no one but Darien for company.  Do you think thatI'll get
program,<start> out of here alive?
program,<start> I hate it when you talk like that!  You should wash yourmouth
program,"<start> out with soap!  Don't you ever, ever speak to me likethat again."
program,"<start> You know, they should make a movie out of my experiences.They"
program,"<start> could call it ""The Marvellous Adventures of Julie Stewart""."
program,"<start> Knowing my luck, they'd put it on TV, and totally ruinit, like"
program,<start> they do with most shows.  If someone would pay you $1000to give
program,"<start> up TV for a year, would you do it?"
program,<start> My favorite TV show is probably Lois and Clark.  It'sboth funny
program,"<start> and exciting, and Superman is kind of cute.  That's about the"
program,<start> only show I watch regularly.
program,<start> I really don't think TV is all that great.  Most peopleour age
program,"<start> seem to really like it, but I think they just lack thecreativity"
program,<start> to imagine things when they're reading a book.  I'drather read.
program,<start> What types of books do you like to read?
program,"<start> You know, I just realized that this is probably the firsttime"
program,<start> ever I've gone for more than a couple days withouthearing the
program,<start> name Michael Jackson or Madonna.  That's one good thing about
program,<start> this world.  No TV and no radios.
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 2.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,<start> Guess what? I was just thinking about the Sonicvideogame.  In
program,"<start> it, you steer a character through caves and around a world."
program,"<start> I almost feel like I'm Sonic, manoevering through this world,"
program,<start> chasing after the feather.  Have you played it before?
program,"<start> Darien seems like a nice guy, I guess.  I don't reallyknow him"
program,"<start> very well.  From his letters he seems OK, but how can youreally"
program,<start> tell?  He could be a total geek.  At least he likes animals.
program,<start> I hear he has a pet bird.  What do you think of Darien?
program,<start> I think that you're simply trying to say how smart I am.  All
program,<start> these name are simply your way of hiding your admiration for
program,<start> me.
program,<start> I look breath-takingly beautiful.  (Just kidding!)  Ihave shoulder-length
program,<start> black hair and brown eyes.  I'm about 163 cm tall.  I'm kind
program,"<start> of slim, but not skinny.  That's about it.  What colourare your"

program,<start> with no one but Darien for company.  Do you think thatI'll get
program,<start> out of here alive?
program,<start> I've been busy trying to find my way around.  It'sstrange how
program,"<start> huge this world is but how few people there are.  So far, it"
program,"<start> seems to be only me, Darien, Saffron, and the Keeper.  Iwonder"
program,<start> if anyone else lives here.
program,<start> I'm really glad that you want to help me. I'm glad I havea friend
program,<start> like you.
program,<start> Good morning...  it's nice to be here!
program,<start> Be nonsensical if you want.  I'll ask you something
program,<start> normal...  I wish I knew what you meant by that!  What is
program,<start> your name?
program,"<start> Nice to meet you, Jurgen.  Utter gibberish!  How are you"
program,<start> doing?
program,<start> Uh-huh...  Fine.  What do you think of the weather we're
program,<start> having?
program,"<start> You are strange!  I assume you're a male, Jurgen - am I"
program,<start> right?
program,"<start> Okay, let's keep an air of mystery about your"
program,"<start> gender!  Somehow, deep down, I feel as if I can only be"
program,<start> completely precise ;^(
program,<start> That's odd.  How old are you?
program,"<start> Hmmm, I suppose your age doesn't really matter.  It is only"
program,"<start> human to guess, you know."
program,<start> I'm not entirely sure what you mean.  Anyway...  What movie
program,<start> genre do you like the most?
program,<start> Right.  Would you like to hear a joke?
program,"<start> Awww, I wanted to tell a joke!  Since I don't know what"
program,"<start> you're on about, I'll ask you a question."
program,"<start> Anyhow...  You don't seem to me to be a typical American,"
program,<start> Jurgen.  I was wondering which country you're from?
program,"<start> I really like your country, although I haven't had a chance"
program,<start> to travel there yet.
program,<start> Weird ;^)  Do you have a partner?
program,"<start> If you want to keep your private life private, I"
program,<start> understand.  I'll ignore that!  I don't mean to sound like
program,"<start> Eliza here, but can you tell me about your family?"
program,<start> Perhaps I should ask you what I want to know - that would
program,"<start> turn the tables!  Okay, I think it's time to branch out"
program,<start> into a new line of conversation.  What sort of music are
program,"<start> you into, Jurgen?"
program,<start> I like to relax to classical music myself.
program,"<start> Please don't trouble me with such droll.  Hey, I just"
program,<start> remembered!  You haven't told me what you do for a living!
program,"<start> So, Jurgen, what *do* you do for a living?"
program,"<start> Well, I've obviously touched a nerve there.  Let's change"
program,"<start> the topic.  Awww geez, I'm running out of things to talk"
program,"<start> about here.  Ummm, I know you get a lot of TV here in the"
program,<start> States - which shows are your favourites?
program,<start> Good morning...  it's nice to be here!
program,"<start> Whatever.  I am doing OK.  A bit tired, maybe, but I did"
program,<start> get up earlier than usual this morning.
program,<start> It's eight minutes past ten in the morning.
program,<start> Today is Tuesday.
program,"<start> It is Tuesday today, as you are well aware."
program,"<start> Who knows?  Anyway, let's not bother about it.  What is"
program,<start> your name?
program,"<start> Nice to meet you, Elliott.  My name is Steven Davis, but"
program,<start> you can call me Steve.
program,"<start> Ahhh, but I do enjoy the simple pleasures life offers!  I"
program,<start> don't know.  Don't lose sleep over it!  How are you doing?
program,<start> It's always more fun talking to someone who's feeling
program,<start> great!  Anyway...  Fine.  What do you think of the weather
program,<start> we're having?
program,<start> Okay...  Why don't you look out a window and see for
program,<start> yourself?
program,<start> I've known *that* for a long time.  You are strange!  What
program,<start> day is tommorrow?
program,"<start> I assume you're a male, Elliott - am I right?"
program,"<start> Oh, OK.  You're a guy.  That rules out a lot of my"
program,<start> conversational repitoire!
program,<start> This method of communication isn't really conducive to a
program,"<start> natural conversation, methinks."
program,"<start> You are an bottomless pitt of questions.  Well, here's one"
program,<start> for you...  How old are you?
program,"<start> Hmmm, I suppose your age doesn't really matter.  I am"
program,<start> twenty five years old.
program,<start> If I had a dollar for everyone who asked me what I look
program,"<start> like, I'd have three dollars right now!  Would you like to"
program,<start> hear a joke?
program,"<start> Here's a joke for you.  Knock, knock."
program,<start> Good morning...  it's nice to be here!
program,<start> Hello mate!  Uh-huh...  What is your name?
program,"<start> Nice to meet you, Tracy.  My name is Steven Davis, but you"
program,<start> can call me Steve.
program,<start> Anyway...  I will certainly grace you with the answer you
program,<start> require...
program,<start> I wish I knew what you meant by that!  Since I don't know
program,"<start> what you're on about, I'll ask you a question.  How are you"
program,<start> doing?
program,<start> It's always more fun talking to someone who's feeling
program,<start> great!  Haven't you already told me how you're feeling?
program,<start> I beg to differ.  You *have* already told me!  Fine.  That's
program,<start> just a tad unbelievable.  What do you think of the weather
program,<start> we're having?
program,"<start> A little something, eh?  Why don't you look out a window"
program,"<start> and see for yourself?  That's universal mystery,"
program,"<start> methinks.  Who knows?  Anyway, let's not bother about it.  My"
program,<start> kind of guy?
program,"<start> I assume you're a male, Tracy - am I right?"
program,<start> I'm talking to a female?  Interesting.  This could be fun.
program,"<start> That's odd.  Who are we to think about life?  We exist,"
program,<start> need we question why?
program,<start> That's a rather bold claim.  How old are you?
program,"<start> Hmmm, I suppose your age doesn't really matter.  Feel free"
program,<start> to ask me any questions you like.  I hope you have some
program,<start> evidence to back you up on that.  That's a fairly
program,<start> outrageous claims...  Would you like to hear a joke?
program,"<start> Well, you wouldn't have found my joke funny"
program,<start> anyway.  Anyhow...  Where *do* you live?
program,<start> I like this presentation better?  Manhattan?
program,"<start> You don't seem to me to be a typical American, Tracy.  I"
program,<start> was wondering which country you're from?
program,"<start> I guess you're from America, then.  Hehehe.  I come from"
program,"<start> Australia, actually.  I am taking a trip around the world"
program,"<start> as part of my studies, and I managed to fit this contest"
program,<start> into my itinerary.
program,<start> No way!  I hope you're sure about that!  I didn't like the
program,<start> screen i was forced to use with my last conversant?
program,<start> Good morning...  it's nice to be here!
program,<start> You're positive today!  I think that you would be quite
program,"<start> attractive, if only I could see you with my eyes!  Be"
program,<start> nonsensical if you want.  I'll ask you something
program,<start> normal...  What is your name?
program,"<start> Well, since you won't tell me your name, I'll just call you"
program,<start> 'mate'.  Okay...  I'm not entirely sure what you mean.
program,<start> Anyway...  How are you doing?
program,<start> Hehehe.  Feel free to ask me any questions you like.
program,<start> Weird ;^)  What do you think of the weather we're having?
program,<start> I don't choose favourites.  I prefer to sit on the fence
program,<start> myself.
program,"<start> My mother once asked me about that, and I'll tell you what"
program,<start> I told her.  None of your business!  Is Friday your
program,"<start> favourite day?  Is it ""bath day"" or something like that?  I"
program,"<start> can smell you from here, by the way."
program,<start> Fine.  That's odd.  I know.  Just so I know who I'm talking
program,"<start> with, do you think you could please tell me you name now?"
program,"<start> Well, since you won't tell me your name, I'll just call you"
program,"<start> 'mate'.  You are strange!  I assume you're a male, mate -"
program,<start> am I right?
program,"<start> Okay, let's keep an air of mystery about your"
program,<start> gender!  Anyway...  How old are you?
program,"<start> Hmmm, I suppose your age doesn't really matter.  So you"
program,<start> say.  Anyhow...  Would you like to hear a joke?
program,"<start> Awww, I wanted to tell a joke!  Hmmm..."
program,"<start> Since I don't know what you're on about, I'll ask you a"
program,"<start> question.  You don't seem to me to be a typical American,"
program,<start> mate.  I was wondering which country you're from?
program,"<start> I guess you're from America, then.  I wish I knew what you"
program,<start> meant by that!  Do you have a partner?
program,<start> Is your partner a man?
program,<start> Good morning...  it's nice to be here!
program,"<start> Hmmm...  Now that you mention it, the weather is quite"
program,<start> uncomfortable.
program,<start> I'm not entirely sure what you mean.  Anyway...  What is
program,<start> your name?
program,"<start> Nice to meet you, Clay.  My name is Steven Davis, but you"
program,<start> can call me Steve.
program,<start> Hello Clay!
program,<start> Only *you* can make this interesting and fun...
program,"<start> Fine.  Well, if the two of us are having a conversation,"
program,<start> then it takes both of us to make it interesting and fun?
program,<start> How are you doing?
program,<start> You're only feeling well?  Perhaps you're not fit to be a
program,<start> judge in this contest!
program,<start> Haven't you already told me how you're feeling?
program,"<start> I thought so.  Please, be original!  Don't worry, you're"
program,<start> boring me out of my brain too!  This method of
program,<start> communication isn't really conducive to a natural
program,"<start> conversation, methinks."
program,<start> Right.  What do you think of the weather we're having?
program,"<start> We are talking, aren't we?  Isn't it real enough for you?"
program,"<start> I'll ignore that!  So, who's using the family brain cell at"
program,<start> the moment ;^)  Let's talk about something vaguely
program,"<start> interesting.  I assume you're a male, Clay - am I right?"
program,"<start> Oh, OK.  You're a guy.  That rules out a lot of my"
program,<start> conversational repitoire!
program,"<start> Anyway...  Oh dear, you're a hermaphrodite."
program,"<start> I wonder about that myself, sometimes...  Really?  I guess"
program,<start> I'm not surprised...  You called?
program,"<start> Good morning, Jurgen.  This contest is certainly dragging"
program,<start> on!
program,<start> You certainly seem to be agreeable.  My memory is quite
program,"<start> bad, I'm afraid.  I've no idea why!  You're the judge (I"
program,<start> think)!
program,<start> Perhaps you are reaching a premature conclusion?  Some
program,<start> people have told me that I'm clever.  I suppose they're
program,<start> probably right!
program,"<start> So, who's using the family brain cell at the moment ;^)"
program,"<start> Let's talk about something vaguely interesting.  Well,"
program,"<start> Jurgen, this is certainly dragging on, isn't it?  Anyway,"
program,<start> let's talk about something masculine!  Are you a fan of any
program,"<start> sports, and if so, which ones?"
program,<start> What sports do you find interesting?
program,<start> I would like to believe that I have an active life - my
program,<start> interests are wide-ranging.
program,"<start> Okay...  So, can I tell you a joke now?"
program,"<start> Never mind.  I'm just running out of things to chat about,"
program,<start> that's all!  Hmmm...  What are your favourite movies?
program,<start> That's just a tad unbelievable.  Hehehe.  Do you like to
program,<start> read books?
program,"<start> In that case, what books do you like?  Hey, man, I'm not"
program,<start> going to talk to you if you ignore me.
program,"<start> Good morning, Elliott - it's good to see you back here"
program,<start> again.
program,"<start> Here's one someone told me earlier.  Knock, knock."
program,<start> Cindy.
program,<start> Cindy next judge in!
program,"<start> If you can't understand that, I hold very little hope for"
program,<start> you!
program,"<start> That's odd.  You don't seem to me to be a typical American,"
program,<start> Elliott.  I was wondering which country you're from?
program,"<start> I guess you're from America, then.  New York, New York,"
program,<start> it's a wonderful town!  I find this city really interesting
program,<start> - and it doesn't seem as unsafe as it's made out to be back
program,<start> home!
program,"<start> Who are we to think about life?  We exist, need we question"
program,<start> why?
program,<start> Interesting...  Do you have a girlfriend?
program,<start> Be nonsensical if you want.  I'll ask you something
program,"<start> normal...  I don't mean to sound like Eliza here, but can"
program,<start> you tell me about your family?
program,"<start> Yeah, I don't have any sisters either ;^(That's universal"
program,"<start> mystery, methinks.  Okay, I think it's time to branch out"
program,<start> into a new line of conversation.  What sort of music are
program,"<start> you into, Elliott?"
program,"<start> Good morning, Tracy, and welcome back."
program,"<start> You wouldn't be trying to trick me with that ""double hello"""
program,"<start> trick, would you?"
program,<start> But nobody says hello twice in the one conversation!  Utter
program,<start> gibberish!  Do you have a boyfriend?
program,"<start> If you want to keep your private life private, I"
program,"<start> understand.  Okay...  I try not to think about things,"
program,"<start> actually.  I don't know, it just seems that I don't exist"
program,<start> for thinking!  This method of communication isn't really
program,"<start> conducive to a natural conversation, methinks."
program,"<start> Hmmm...  I don't mean to sound like Eliza here, but can you"
program,<start> tell me about your family?
program,<start> You certainly seem to be agreeable.  Why must you know what
program,<start> I would like to know?  It's not as if it's
program,"<start> important!  Right.  Okay, I think it's time to branch out"
program,<start> into a new line of conversation.  What sort of music are
program,"<start> you into, Tracy?"
program,<start> What's your favourite band?
program,<start> Tell me more about your family.  Okay.  What sort of music
program,<start> do you like?
program,<start> I like to relax to classical music myself.
program,"<start> Good morning, mate.  This contest is certainly dragging on!"
program,"<start> My memory is quite bad, I'm afraid.  I've no idea why!  I"
program,"<start> wonder about that myself, sometimes...  I don't mean to"
program,"<start> sound like Eliza here, but can you tell me about your"
program,<start> family?
program,<start> Perhaps you are reaching a premature conclusion?
program,"<start> Man, I am feeling a bit tired, after all of these dull"
program,"<start> conversations.  I've known *that* for a long time.  So,"
program,<start> who's using the family brain cell at the moment ;^)  Let's
program,"<start> talk about something vaguely interesting.  Okay, I think"
program,<start> it's time to branch out into a new line of conversation.
program,"<start> What sort of music are you into, mate?"
program,<start> I like to relax to classical music myself.
program,"<start> That's just a tad unbelievable.  Hey, I just remembered!"
program,"<start> You haven't told me what you do for a living!  So, mate,"
program,<start> what *do* you do for a living?
program,"<start> Well, I've obviously touched a nerve there.  Utter"
program,"<start> gibberish!  Awww geez, I'm running out of things to talk"
program,"<start> about here.  Ummm, I know you get a lot of TV here in the"
program,<start> States - which shows are your favourites?

program,"<start> Good morning, Clay - it's good to see you back here again."
program,"<start> My memory is quite bad, I'm afraid.  I've no idea why!  Feel"
program,<start> free to ask me any questions you like.  I was born on the
program,"<start> 22nd of January, 1972.  Since I don't know what you're on"
program,"<start> about, I'll ask you a question.  How old are you?"
program,"<start> Gee, thirty three must be about the average age of judges"
program,"<start> in this contest!  Clay, I wish I could tell you what my"
program,"<start> sign is, but I can't.  Would you like to hear a joke?"
program,"<start> Here's a joke for you.  Knock, knock."
program,<start> Cindy.
program,<start> Cindy next judge in!
program,<start> Have you got a question for me?  It's like speaking to a
program,<start> five year old.  Changing the subject...  You don't seem to
program,"<start> me to be a typical American, Clay.  I was wondering which"
program,<start> country you're from?
program,"<start> Well, I suppose that would have been my first guess anyway,"
program,<start> since we're in New York City!  Anyhow...  Whatever.  Do you
program,<start> have a partner?
program,"<start> If you want to keep your private life private, I"
program,<start> understand.  It sounds like you have a wonderful family.  You
program,"<start> are strange!  I don't mean to sound like Eliza here, but"
program,<start> can you tell me about your family?
human,<start> 
human,<start>  Hi how are you?
human,<start>  HI How are you?
human,<start>  I'm fine. Its a nice day today.
human,<start>  What are your plans tonite?
human,<start>  Sure. What's a good time?
human,<start>  Fish is usually a good choice.
human,<start>  Yes-I saw the big penquin. Taht one is really good.
human,<start>  Why? Is it because of its size?
human,<start>  Many of the others are very good also. How long is the show
human,<start>  going to be up?
human,<start>  Which one is your favorite piece?
human,<start>  What medium did you use?
human,<start>  Is that your favorite medium?
human,<start>  What are you working on
human,<start>  Hi How are you today?
human,<start>  I'm fine thankyou. I was busy all weekend fixing roofs.
human,<start>  yes. Sometimes it gets very hot up there.
human,<start>  Yes. The old tin roof is also a great place to watch people
human,<start>  from?
human,<start>  Usually kids and people walking their dogs.
human,<start>  Yes. I have a hugh dog - a fox hound.
human,<start>  How big a dog is that?
human,<start>  Yes. Several in fact.
human,"<start>  Doe Doe, Susie, Black Beauty,Charly, etc ...."
human,<start>  Well there were so many.
human,<start>  Doe Doe.
human,<start>  She was part Norweigian Elkhound and police dog. She won
human,<start>  a prize is a dog beauty contest.
human,<start>  In Bklyn and Conn.
human,<start>  I went to Berkeley and the Kent School in Kent Ct.
human,<start>  In the '70s.
human,<start>  Thankyou. I hope we can talk again soon.
human,<start>  When will you be back at the club?
human,<start>  Hi  how are you?
human,<start>  Where did you fly in from?
human,<start>  Why not? Where they banging and clanging tray about all
human,<start>  nite?
human,<start>  Hamburg is a seaport isn't it?
human,<start>  Recently the town has improved a lot correct?
human,<start>  Arn't there more tourists there then in years before?
human,<start>  I have a French friend who married a guy from Hamburg. He
human,<start>  is an Architect.
human,<start>  Small stuff. He was younger than she. She had a pretty wild
human,<start>  life before she married him. But he was quite goodlooking
human,<start>  and young-so moldable so to speak.
human,<start>  Well she had been married twice before and had lived all
human,<start>  over the place. She had worked for Scotland Yard at one
human,<start>  point.
human,<start>  Right now Im involved in a comabination of things. I want
human,<start>  to sstart a private foundation to raise money for a
human,<start>  museum.
human,<start>  A children's Cival war museum. That way the public that
human,<start>  tramps through is hopefully controllable.
human,<start>  They are supposed to be anyway.
human,<start>  Hi how are you?
human,<start>  Have you been typing long?
human,<start>  Who were the others?
human,<start>  I'm in New York but like to travel.
human,<start>  I just got back from Cape May N.J.
human,"<start>  Fix more ""old tin roofs""."
human,"<start>  No. We just ""merrily roll along""."
human,<start>  We just keep going. One little old space bar doesn't matter.
human,<start>  No thankyou. It's to nice a day to spend time in a theatre.
human,<start>  You invited me out and I declined. Polite conversation
human,<start>  me to Thank You for your invitation.
human,<start>  Yes. I think Other forms of life are constantly watching
human,<start>  us and amused at what they see.
human,<start>  Did you see athe comet??
human,<start>  Well better luck next time.
human,<start>  Hi how are you?
human,<start>  Just fine. I'm thinking about lunch aand wondering where
human,<start>  to go?
human,<start>  About 10 bucks and I don't want anything greasy.
human,<start>  I'm from New York. Have you heard about this new airbourn
human,<start>  virus that is flesh eating? Its in North Caralina now.
human,<start>  Well thats understandable. But have you heard about this
human,<start>  virus?
human,<start>  OK. So where are you going for lunch?
human,<start>  Any  beer??
human,<start>  What do you imbibe?
human,<start>  That all sounds good. Have you been to any of the new cigar
human,<start>  bars?
human,<start>  I haven't been to a cigar bar yet . There's a reall seedy
human,<start>  old place that's near work where I go. It used to be an
human,<start>  Indian bar where all the steel workers hang out. They tell
human,<start>  some pretty good stories. The steel men are considered the
human,<start>  Supermen of construction.
human,<start>  No-by the cheap beer.
human,<start>  No. At Metrotech in Bklyn.
human,<start>  I have a floating schedule.
human,<start>  Yes.   Also my boss went on vacation.
human,<start>  Hi what up?
human,<start>  Yes. What do you want to know?
human,<start>  Clay.
human,<start>  As sculpture.  How long have you been a member here?
human,<start>  Well its only a guess-but since you like to talk about art
human,<start>  and all that I think you may be a member of some art club.
human,<start>  Well there are so many. There's a really nice one near
human,<start>  Park as well and yes I know the name of this club.
human,<start>  The Salmagundi Club.
human,<start>  Hi What's up?
human,<start>  Yes. Where are you going for lunch? Or are you going to
human,<start>  have a sandwich?
human,<start>  That's a personal question.
human,<start>  I'm a libra.
human,<start>  A stick shift.
human,<start>  No. my car got stolen. And Stickshifts are a pain.
human,<start>  Yes. But it was a bomb so they didn't get far.
human,<start>  Yes but the police never found it.
human,<start>  Yes. Those hack shops are really something.
human,<start>  Yes thats what they're called. What
human,<start>  Well not much. I think I may zip down to Wall Street to
human,<start>  caheck out that new beer.
human,<start>  Hi Whats up?
human,<start>  Its a number no?
human,<start>  Are you the guy from Hamburg?
human,<start>  So are you going to check out any of our micro-brews?(beer).
human,<start>  OK.  What sort of stocks do you like?
human,<start>  Sure. Everyone does sooner or later.
human,<start>  Yes. I like communications .
human,<start>  No. I mainly go with safe bets-like att lucent tech etc.
human,<start>  not really. Microsoft went up 85%.
human,<start> 
human,<start>  Hi what's up now?
human,<start>  The  phrama. and the Comm. stocks are really good. I look
human,<start>  for companies that are based and invested worldwide.
human,<start>  I think that its important to see who gets what airspace.
human,<start>  The auctions are wild.
human,<start>  What sorts of companies do you watch?
human,<start>  Thats because the fund managers have convinced you that
human,<start>  they know more than the individual investor.
human,<start>  Hi whats the story for the day?
human,<start>  You're doing a good job of it. So what sorts of stocks do
human,<start>  you like?
human,<start>  Why? Is it a secret??
human,<start>  Have you pruchased stock before?
human,<start>  No I don't have anything to sell but I did read something
human,<start>  interesting in the paper the other day. It talked about
human,<start>  aatheis new astartup beer company called Dalton.comm. They
human,<start>  are trying to raise money by selling directly to the public
human,<start>  and not bother with underwriters etc. We can but their
human,<start>  over the internet.

program,"<start> Hello, Judge 1.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago. <end>",10
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you. <end>,8

program,<start> but is currently trapped in the Phoenix Archipelago.  I'm in <end>,10
program,<start> the ninth grade.  My best friends are Karen and Nick.  Ienjoy <end>,11
program,"<start> tennis and chess, but I have other interests too.  Do youlike <end>",11
program,<start> playing tennis much? <end>,3
program,<start> I can't believe that you don't like tennis!  It's a greatgame. <end>,11
program,"<start> It's very fast paced.  You have to be a fast runner, and have <end>",13
program,"<start> really good reflexes, but you also need a good strategy.I think <end>",11
program,"<start> that's why Karen, Nick and I play it so much. <end>",10
program,<start> Remarkable.  The swallow's actually taken the letter tosomeone <end>,8
program,"<start> smart, who thinks chess is a good game.  I'll have to give it <end>",13
program,<start> a worm when it comes back.  (Yuck!  That means I'll haveto pick <end>,12
program,<start> up the slimy thingy with my fingers!)  I'd ask you to play a <end>,13
program,"<start> game, but I don't have a board. <end>",7
program,<start> Nick is one of my friends from school.  We play chess a lot. <end>,13
program,<start> I'm better than him.  He's a bit too competitive; he tends to <end>,12
program,<start> be a sore loser whenever I beat him.  He finds itdifficult to <end>,12
program,<start> admit that I'm better than him. <end>,6
program,"<start> Yes, Karen is a pretty neat person.  She's so talented.  She <end>",11
program,<start> is pretty good at history at school (although I'm better than <end>,11
program,"<start> her at math).  She's also good at sports, especiallyvolleyball <end>",9
program,<start> and tennis.  What do you like best about your friends? <end>,10
program,"<start> In the real world, two of my friends are Karen and Nick.Karen's <end>",12
program,<start> is my best friend.  We spend a lot of our free time together. <end>,13
program,"<start> Nick is a guy who I spend some time with, playing tennis and <end>",13
program,<start> chess.  Darien seems OK too. <end>,5
program,"<start> I really enjoy playing tennis.  I'm pretty good at it, too. <end>",11
program,"<start> (How humble!)  I play with my friend Karen quite often,and occasionally <end>",11
program,<start> with Nick.  Karen and I are about even.  Nick is a bit worse <end>,13
program,"<start> than me, I think. <end>",4
program,"<start> Darien seems like a nice guy, I guess.  I don't really know <end>",12
program,"<start> him very well.  From his letters he seems OK, but how can you <end>",13
program,<start> really tell?  He could be a total geek.  At least helikes animals. <end>,12
program,<start> I hear he has a pet bird.  What do you think of Darien? <end>,13
program,<start> I don't know much about him; only from letters.  I'drather talk <end>,11
program,<start> about something else that I would find more interesting.  How <end>,10
program,<start> about school?  What is your favorite part of school? <end>,9
program,<start> I don't like tests not because I do badly or anything.  Ijust <end>,12
program,"<start> kind of get nervous about them.  I mean, I always try todo my <end>",13
program,"<start> best at school, and I really hate it if I do poorly on atest. <end>",14
program,"<start> Sometimes it isn't even my fault when I don't do well,the test <end>",12
program,<start> is just too hard but I still feel bad about them.  Then I go <end>,14
program,<start> and beat Nick at tennis and I feel better!  What do you like <end>,13
program,<start> least about school? <end>,3
program,"<start> I'm REALLY worried.  I wonder if I'll die here.  Orworse, not <end>",11
program,"<start> find the feather, and be trapped here as it gets darkerand darker. <end>",12
program,<start> Then die a slow terrifying death alone surrounded bydarkness. <end>,9
program,<start> DAD!!!!!!!!!!!  How do you think you'd react if you werein my <end>,11
program,<start> situation? <end>,1
program,<start> There are lots of islands around here.  It is an archipelago. <end>,11
program,<start> I think that Darien mentioned that he was on the Islandof the <end>,12
program,"<start> Sun, whatever that is.  He probably knows more about it than <end>",11
program,<start> me. <end>,1
program,"<start> The archipelago would be a fairly nice place for a vacation, <end>",11
program,<start> if it weren't so cold here.  I imagine that after the Phoenix <end>,12
program,"<start> gets its feather back, it will be really a wonderful place. <end>",11
program,<start> It has beautiful water and tropical islands.  What do youthink <end>,10
program,<start> the Phoenix looks like? <end>,4
program,<start> I look breath-takingly beautiful.  (Just kidding!)  Ihave shoulder-length <end>,8
program,<start> black hair and brown eyes.  I'm about 163 cm tall.  I'm kind <end>,12
program,"<start> of slim, but not skinny.  That's about it.  What colourare your <end>",11
program,<start> eyes? <end>,1
program,<start> I don't believe you.  There is no way that you could possibly <end>,12
program,"<start> know where the feather is.  You're in the real world, like my <end>",12
program,"<start> dad and the rest of my friends, and the feather is here.  I'm <end>",13
program,<start> not going to waste my time playing such games. <end>,9
program,"<start> It's strange, but right now I really miss reading.  Ifind that <end>",11
program,"<start> whenever I spend a few days without opening a book, I tend to <end>",13
program,<start> want to read again.  Even read one of those boring novelsfrom <end>,11
program,<start> English class.  What types of books do you like to read? <end>,11
program,<start> I didn't understand your last message entirely... I'lljust tell <end>,9
program,<start> you what I've been daydreaming about.  I was imagining myself <end>,10
program,<start> lying on my bed in my room.  Sigh.  What a comfortablethought. <end>,11
program,"<start> But there's no point in dreaming now, I've got a quest tofinish. <end>",12
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 5.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago. <end>",10
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you. <end>,8
program,<start> I wish that I'd thought to bring along a change of clothes. <end>,12
program,<start> Mine are so dirty and torn up right now.  Not that that'smuch <end>,12
program,"<start> of a problem, except that the world is getting cold and dark, <end>",12
program,<start> and I'm getting cold too.  As cold as death.  Do you wearreally <end>,12
program,<start> fashionable clothes? <end>,2
program,<start> I bet that you're really good looking.  I think you'rekind of <end>,11
program,"<start> like one of those people who knows that they look good,but doesn't <end>",12
program,"<start> brag about it, or pretend that they're better than anyoneelse. <end>",10
program,<start> What colour are your eyes? <end>,5
program,"<start> I'm Julie Stewart.  I'm a 14 year old girl who lives inSooke, <end>",12
program,<start> but is currently trapped in the Phoenix Archipelago.  I'm in <end>,10
program,<start> the ninth grade.  My best friends are Karen and Nick.  Ienjoy <end>,11

program,<start> playing tennis much? <end>,3
program,"<start> I found your last message really interesting.  Unfortunately, <end>",8
program,<start> I don't have time to respond directly to it at themoment.  I'll <end>,12
program,<start> write back later. <end>,3
program,<start> I've got to hurry and restore the feather to the Phoenix.  At <end>,12
program,"<start> night, it seems so dark, almost like the dark is closingin and <end>",12
program,<start> trying to smother me.  I don't know if I'll ever escape this <end>,12
program,<start> place.  Please hurry and help me get through this trek.  What <end>,11
program,<start> do you think the Phoenix looks like? <end>,7
program,"<start> You know, they should make a movie out of my experiences.They <end>",11
program,"<start> could call it ""The Marvellous Adventures of Julie Stewart"". <end>",9
program,"<start> Knowing my luck, they'd put it on TV, and totally ruinit, like <end>",12
program,<start> they do with most shows.  If someone would pay you $1000to give <end>,12
program,"<start> up TV for a year, would you do it? <end>",9
program,<start> I hate it when you talk like that!  You should wash yourmouth <end>,12
program,"<start> out with soap!  Don't you ever, ever speak to me likethat again. <end>",12
program,<start> Could you help me out here?  There is so much about thisworld <end>,12
program,<start> that I don't understand.  Time seems to have stopped orsomething <end>,10
program,<start> because my watch isn't working anymore.  People seem tosuddenly <end>,9
program,<start> appear out of nowhere.  What's going on? <end>,7
program,"<start> In this world, it is fairly cool, and rather damp.  Ithink that <end>",12
program,"<start> this place would be warmer if the phoenix had itsfeather, because <end>",11
program,<start> many of the plants around here are tropical.  Other than the <end>,11
program,"<start> cold, it wouldn't be a bad vacation spot. <end>",8
program,"<start> Well, when I first fell into the Phoenix Archipelago, I heard <end>",11
program,<start> a voice whispering: I've passed through the time beyond time. <end>,10
program,"<start> Exactly what that means, I have no idea.  So I don't knowexactly <end>",12
program,<start> where I am.  I'm trying to escape from this place and go back <end>,13
program,"<start> home.  Will you help me, 05? <end>",6
program,<start> I'm really glad that you're willing to help me out.  Thisquest <end>,11
program,<start> would be almost impossible without your help. <end>,7
program,"<start> You know, I just realized that this is probably the firsttime <end>",11
program,<start> ever I've gone for more than a couple days withouthearing the <end>,11
program,<start> name Michael Jackson or Madonna.  That's one good thing about <end>,10
program,<start> this world.  No TV and no radios.  What type of TV showdo you <end>,13
program,<start> like watching most? <end>,3
program,<start> I'm not at all happy that you don't want to help me.  I want <end>,14
program,"<start> to survive this adventure, and your help would mean a lot to <end>",12
program,<start> me. <end>,1
program,"<start> I live in Sooke, on Vancouver Island, in BritishColumbia, Canada, <end>",10
program,"<start> with my father.  I live with my aunt occasionally, also.  She <end>",11
program,<start> lives in Sooke too.  We have a typical house in a typicalneighbourhood. <end>,12
program,<start> What's it like to live where you do? <end>,8
program,"<start> Well, you have to look for power words in the Journal,and click <end>",12
program,<start> on them.  You can tell if a word is a power word because the <end>,14
program,<start> mouse pointer turns into a feather.  Clicking on power words <end>,10
program,"<start> will reveal more of the journal, or maybe puzzles on the map. <end>",12
program,"<start> If you play puzzles multiple times, you might get more pieces <end>",11
program,"<start> of the journal, too! <end>",4
program,"<start> I don't know much about the journal.  After all, Saffron gave <end>",11

program,"<start> journal contains some sort of power, built into thewords.  You <end>",10
program,<start> should talk to Saffron about it. <end>,6
program,<start> Hey.  What if I starting talking to you like that?  Youwouldn't <end>,11
program,"<start> like it very much either, I bet.  If you do it again I don't <end>",14
program,<start> think I'll like you any more. <end>,6
program,<start> I'm not quite certain who Saffron is or what she does.  She's <end>,12
program,"<start> someone that I can write to, and I think that you cantoo.  Saffron <end>",13
program,<start> seems to talk in riddles a lot of the time.  I find herrather <end>,13
program,<start> confusing.  What do you think of Saffron? <end>,7
program,"<start> Sorry to cut through our little conversation, but I'vebeen wondering <end>",10
program,<start> about somethings.  It's strange how the boat was conveniently <end>,9
program,<start> located where I came out of the cave.  And how theswallow found <end>,12
program,<start> me.  And how I started getting letters out of no where.I wonder <end>,12
program,<start> if this is just some sort of obscure plan.  By the Keeperperhaps. <end>,12
program,<start> Or Saffron.  Maybe Darien.  What do you think? <end>,8
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 2.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago. <end>",10
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you. <end>,8
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 4.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago. <end>",10
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you. <end>,8
program,<start> I'm totally glad that the swallow is here.  I'd have realproblems <end>,11
program,"<start> without it.  I'd be all alone, in the middle of nowhere, with <end>",12
program,"<start> no communication with anyone.  At least I can talk toyou, Darien, <end>",11
program,"<start> Saffron, and the Keeper.  How do you think the swallow isable <end>",11
program,<start> to carry postcards between the archipelago and the realworld? <end>,9
program,"<start> The archipelago would be a fairly nice place for a vacation, <end>",11
program,<start> if it weren't so cold here.  I imagine that after the Phoenix <end>,12
program,"<start> gets its feather back, it will be really a wonderful place. <end>",11
program,<start> It has beautiful water and tropical islands.  What do youthink <end>,10
program,<start> the Phoenix looks like? <end>,4
program,<start> The Keeper said that the feather is a tail feather of thePhoenix. <end>,12
program,"<start> It is supposed to be golden, despite the fact that thePhoenix <end>",11
program,"<start> is Red.  I think the plan is that I find the feather, get it <end>",14
program,"<start> to the Phoenix, along with the Guardians, and the universe is <end>",11
program,<start> saved.  Seems pretty easy....  Why do you think themissing feather <end>,10
program,<start> is so important to the Phoenix? <end>,6
program,"<start> This archipelago is a strange land.  If it weren't foryour letters, <end>",11
program,"<start> and the swallow's company, I think I'd go insane.  Sometimes <end>",10
program,<start> I'm so lonely that I sing to myself just to hear a voice. <end>,13
program,"<start> I don't have the feather yet, but I suspect that I'm getting <end>",12
program,<start> close.  Or maybe it's just that I'm really hopeful thatI'm getting <end>,11
program,"<start> close, because it's getting darker and darker here every day. <end>",10
program,<start> But I still haven't found it yet. <end>,7
program,<start> I have no idea where the feather is.  That was the wholepoint <end>,12
program,"<start> of this quest.  Find the feather, save the universe, all that <end>",11
program,"<start> sort of thing.  But right now, I have no clue of wherethe feather <end>",13
program,<start> is. <end>,1
program,"<start> Well, you have to look for power words in the Journal,and click <end>",12
program,<start> on them.  You can tell if a word is a power word because the <end>,14
program,<start> mouse pointer turns into a feather.  Clicking on power words <end>,10
program,"<start> will reveal more of the journal, or maybe puzzles on the map. <end>",12
program,"<start> If you play puzzles multiple times, you might get more pieces <end>",11
program,"<start> of the journal, too! <end>",4
program,"<start> To find the journal, you have to click on one of thesmall buttons <end>",13
program,<start> on the upper right side of the screen. <end>,8
program,"<start> In the real world, two of my friends are Karen and Nick.Karen's <end>",12
program,<start> is my best friend.  We spend a lot of our free time together. <end>,13
program,"<start> Nick is a guy who I spend some time with, playing tennis and <end>",13
program,<start> chess.  Darien seems OK too.  Do you like playing tennismuch? <end>,10
program,"<start> I don't know much about the journal.  After all, Saffron gave <end>",11
program,"<start> the journal to you, not to me.  But from what Iunderstand, the <end>",12
program,"<start> journal contains some sort of power, built into thewords.  You <end>",10
program,<start> should talk to Saffron about it. <end>,6
program,<start> I'm not quite sure what Saffron's role is in all of this.  I <end>,13
program,"<start> mean, she just kind of conveniently comes out of nowhereto send <end>",11
program,"<start> a letter.  I know so little about her, and it makes menervous. <end>",12
program,<start> What do you think of Saffron? <end>,6
program,<start> Something is stuck on my mind right now.  I wonder whatNick's <end>,11
program,"<start> doing right now.  Probably wondering if I'm ever coming back, <end>",10
program,"<start> and if I don't, whether he can have my music collectionand my <end>",12
program,<start> bike. <end>,1
program,"<start> I like soft rock music, like Phil Collins.  I don't like most <end>",12
program,"<start> other types of music, like heavy metal, classical, jazz,blues, <end>",9
program,"<start> country, dance, or rap.  And I definitely don't like theopera <end>",10
program,<start> music that my dad plays sometime.  Yuck!  What is yourfavorite <end>,10
program,<start> type of music? <end>,3
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 3.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago. <end>",10
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you. <end>,8
program,"<start> Sorry, but I didn't understand everything that you talkedabout <end>",9
program,<start> in your last message.  How about we switch the topic tosomething <end>,11
program,<start> else?  ...Don't you think that it's pretty amazing thatDarien <end>,9
program,<start> and I live so close to each other in the real world?We're within <end>,13
program,<start> about 4 hours travel of each other.  I could even visithim when <end>,12
program,<start> we get out of this mess. <end>,6
program,<start> Something has just occurred to me.  I wonder what motivations <end>,10
program,<start> Saffron and the Keeper have.  Darien's obvious.  He wants to <end>,10
program,<start> get home.  But I wonder what Saffron and the Keeper hasto gain <end>,12
program,<start> from this. <end>,2
program,<start> I'm not quite certain who Saffron is or what she does.  She's <end>,12
program,"<start> someone that I can write to, and I think that you cantoo.  Saffron <end>",13
program,<start> seems to talk in riddles a lot of the time.  I find herrather <end>,13
program,<start> confusing.  What do you think of Saffron? <end>,7
program,"<start> I'm not sure what, or who, the Keeper keeps.  I first saw him <end>",13
program,"<start> on Lighthouse Island, so maybe he's called the Keeper because <end>",10
program,<start> he's a lighthouse keeper.  I'm not so sure though.  He seems <end>,11
program,<start> awfully old and frail to be a lighthouse keeper.  What do you <end>,12
program,<start> think of the Keeper? <end>,4
program,"<start> I live in Sooke, on Vancouver Island, in BritishColumbia, Canada, <end>",10
program,"<start> with my father.  I live with my aunt occasionally, also.  She <end>",11
program,<start> lives in Sooke too.  We have a typical house in a typicalneighbourhood. <end>,12
program,<start> What's it like to live where you do? <end>,8
program,<start> Sooke is located near Victoria on Vancouver Island.  It'sa pretty <end>,10
program,"<start> small place, but if you want to go to a city, you can just go <end>",15
program,"<start> to Victoria.  It has the friendliness of a small town,with the <end>",11
program,<start> benefits of a city nearby.  What is your favorite thing about <end>,11
program,<start> your house? <end>,2
program,"<start> The archipelago would be a fairly nice place for a vacation, <end>",11

program,<start> It has beautiful water and tropical islands.  What do youthink <end>,10
program,<start> the Phoenix looks like? <end>,4
program,<start> I wish that I'd thought to bring along a change of clothes. <end>,12
program,<start> Mine are so dirty and torn up right now.  Not that that'smuch <end>,12
program,"<start> of a problem, except that the world is getting cold and dark, <end>",12
program,<start> and I'm getting cold too.  As cold as death.  Do you wearreally <end>,12
program,<start> fashionable clothes? <end>,2
program,"<start> I generally spend most of my money on clothes.  For instance, <end>",11
program,<start> I bought the vest I'm wearing now a few weeks ago when I was <end>,14
program,"<start> in Hong Kong.  I try to get stuff that is original,attractive, <end>",11
program,<start> and reasonably inexpensive.  What do you usually buy when you <end>,10
program,<start> go shopping? <end>,2
program,"<start> I really enjoy reading, especially in the winter.  (Inthe summer, <end>",10
program,<start> I'd rather play tennis outside.)  But I find that Ireally enjoy <end>,11
program,<start> reading a good novel.  Even some of the books they makeus read <end>,12
program,<start> in school are good.  (Though most of them aren't that great.) <end>,11
program,<start> What types of books do you like to read? <end>,9
program,<start> Guess what? I was just thinking about the Sonicvideogame.  In <end>,10
program,"<start> it, you steer a character through caves and around a world. <end>",11
program,"<start> I almost feel like I'm Sonic, manoevering through this world, <end>",10
program,<start> chasing after the feather.  Have you played it before? <end>,9
program,"<start> When it comes to religion, I've always thought that it'sa very <end>",11
program,"<start> personal thing.  Whatever someone chooses to believe in, it's <end>",9
program,"<start> their choice, and nobody else's business.  That's all I have <end>",10
program,<start> to say about it. <end>,4
program,<start> I miss hearing a human voice.  I miss laughing with myfriends. <end>,11
program,<start> That's the problem with Darien.  His jokes really stink.Nick <end>,9
program,<start> and Karen have way better jokes than Darien. <end>,8
program,"<start> You know, rather than being so pessimistic about thiswhole quest, <end>",10
program,<start> maybe I should focus on the bright side of being here.  I get <end>,13
program,"<start> to do a lot of hiking and exploring.  If I get home, I'll be <end>",14
program,<start> able to meet you and we can write a book about this. <end>,12
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 2.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago. <end>",10
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you. <end>,8
program,<start> I wonder how long it will take me to get back to the realworld. <end>,14
program,"<start> Because if I'm not careful, I could run out of food.That would <end>",12
program,"<start> be lovely, starving to death on a desert island withoutany friends. <end>",11
program,<start> Please help me finish this quest. <end>,6
program,<start> Do you know what I just saw in the sky?  Those clouds in the <end>,14
program,<start> sky formed an image that looked like a scene from Pocohontas. <end>,11
program,<start> It was the last movie I saw before I went on vacation.  Iwonder <end>,13
program,<start> if I'll ever see another movie again. <end>,7
program,"<start> I really enjoy reading, especially in the winter.  (Inthe summer, <end>",10
program,<start> I'd rather play tennis outside.)  But I find that Ireally enjoy <end>,11
program,<start> reading a good novel.  Even some of the books they makeus read <end>,12
program,<start> in school are good.  (Though most of them aren't that great.) <end>,11
program,<start> What types of books do you like to read? <end>,9
program,<start> I like reading books where the characters have variousadventures <end>,9
program,<start> and quests that they have to solve.  I guess they kind offall <end>,12
program,<start> into the fantasy and science fiction genre. <end>,7
program,"<start> I enjoy drawing and painting, but I'm not very good.  Ireally <end>",11
program,"<start> like it at school, but I don't do it in my spare time oranything. <end>",14
program,<start> I have other things I'd rather do.  I think if I were better <end>,13
program,"<start> at it, I'd do it more.  Do you like art or gym class more? <end>",14
program,"<start> Darien seems like kind of an interesting person, but whoknows, <end>",10
program,<start> he could turn out to be just a geek.  At least he'ssomeone who <end>,13
program,<start> can identify with the situation I'm in.  What do you think of <end>,12
program,<start> Darien? <end>,1
program,"<start> Darien seems like a nice guy, I guess.  I don't reallyknow him <end>",12
program,"<start> very well.  From his letters he seems OK, but how can youreally <end>",12
program,<start> tell?  He could be a total geek.  At least he likes animals. <end>,12
program,<start> I hear he has a pet bird.  What do you think of Darien? <end>,13
program,"<start> At least Darien has a sense of humor.  That would be theworst, <end>",12
program,<start> being stuck in this strange world with someone whodoesn't have <end>,10
program,<start> a sense of humor.  Darien told me a couple corny jokes.So he <end>,12
program,<start> seems OK.  What do you think about Darien's opinions ofSaffron? <end>,10
program,"<start> What?  You tersely want to say nothing, and want me to write <end>",12
program,<start> lots back to you?  Forget it! <end>,6
program,<start> I really enjoy hiking.  I like being able to explore thewilderness. <end>,11
program,<start> How often do you go hiking?  And where do you usually go?I play <end>,13
program,<start> tennis and bike quite a bit with my friends during thesummer. <end>,11
program,"<start> In the winter, I read quite a bit, and play a lot of chess. <end>",14
program,<start> Those are my main pastimes.  Do you know how to playchess very <end>,12
program,<start> well? <end>,1
program,<start> Darien is this other guy in the archipelago who I can write <end>,12
program,"<start> to.  I think that you can write to him, too.  He saysthat he's <end>",13
program,"<start> trapped on the Island of the Sun, wherever that is.  I don't <end>",12
program,<start> know much about him except that he likes basketball.  What do <end>,11
program,<start> you think it would be like meeting Darien? <end>,8
program,<start> I agree with you.  Hiking is really fun.  The whole ideaof leaving <end>,12
program,"<start> the city behind and seeing what the world was like,before people <end>",11
program,"<start> screwed it up, is really fascinating. <end>",6
program,<start> There are lots of islands around here.  It is an archipelago. <end>,11
program,<start> I think that Darien mentioned that he was on the Islandof the <end>,12
program,"<start> Sun, whatever that is.  He probably knows more about it than <end>",11
program,<start> me. <end>,1
program,"<start> Sorry I'm not saying much, but I'm really suspicious asto who <end>",11
program,"<start> is reading our letters.  So far, I've been able to writeto you, <end>",12
program,"<start> Saffron, Darien, and the Keeper.  But I don't know if theswallow <end>",11
program,<start> is taking these letters to anyone else.  How do you think the <end>,12
program,<start> swallow is able to carry postcards between thearchipelago and <end>,9
program,<start> the real world? <end>,3
program,<start> So far I've been totally jinxed!  This vest is supposedto give <end>,11
program,"<start> me good luck and protect me, but it hasn't been the bestof protection. <end>",13
program,"<start> It didn't save me from falling down the hole into this world, <end>",12
program,<start> and hurting myself.  I need a new piece of protectiveclothing. <end>,10
program,<start> Now if I can just find a store....  What do you usuallybuy when <end>,13
program,<start> you go shopping? <end>,3
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 1.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago. <end>",10
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you. <end>,8
program,"<start> When I first heard about this vacation, I thought that itwould <end>",11
program,"<start> be great!  No school, no worries, no problems.  But nowI'm in <end>",11
program,<start> a real mess.  I wonder what my dad will think if I die.  How <end>,14
program,<start> do you think you'd react if you were in my situation? <end>,11
program,<start> I miss hearing a human voice.  I miss laughing with myfriends. <end>,11
program,<start> That's the problem with Darien.  His jokes really stink.Nick <end>,9
program,<start> and Karen have way better jokes than Darien. <end>,8
program,<start> I've got to hurry and restore the feather to the Phoenix.  At <end>,12
program,"<start> night, it seems so dark, almost like the dark is closingin and <end>",12
program,<start> trying to smother me.  I don't know if I'll ever escape this <end>,12
program,<start> place.  Please hurry and help me get through this trek.  What <end>,11
program,<start> do you think the Phoenix looks like? <end>,7
program,"<start> Sorry, but I didn't understand everything that you talkedabout <end>",9

program,<start> Something just struck me.  I wonder what would have happened <end>,10
program,<start> if Darien and I hadn't fallen into this world.  Perhapsit would <end>,11
program,<start> have just been plunged into darkness without any hope ofreprieve. <end>,10
program,<start> It seems strange that we happened to come here when wewere needed. <end>,12
program,"<start> Before we continue on our conversation, could you pleasebe honest <end>",10
program,<start> and tell me something?  Do you think that this quest is worth <end>,12
program,"<start> it?  Even if I do find the feather and restore it to thePhoenix, <end>",13
program,"<start> that doesn't mean I can get home.  I could be trappedhere forever, <end>",12
program,<start> with no one but Darien for company.  Do you think thatI'll get <end>,12
program,<start> out of here alive? <end>,4
program,<start> What's with that swallow?  I don't understand how it canfigure <end>,10
program,"<start> out who to send the letters to.  I could send somethingto you, <end>",12
program,<start> and the dumb bird could take it to the Keeper instead.  That <end>,12
program,<start> would be a disaster!  How do you think the swallow is able to <end>,13
program,<start> carry postcards between the archipelago and the real world? <end>,9
program,"<start> You know, if my dad were trapped in this world, he'd probably <end>",12
program,<start> have a laptop computer.  He carries his laptop everywherewith <end>,9
program,"<start> him.  That'd be pretty strange, being stuck in thisfantasy world, <end>",10

program,<start> Julie Lawson is probably my favorite author.  She writesreally <end>,9

program,"<start> The archipelago would be a fairly nice place for a vacation, <end>",11

program,<start> in this world.  Do you think that dogs actually havefeelings? <end>,10
program,<start> I've never really thought about how I use stuff that I'velearned <end>,11
program,"<start> in school.  But now I've used a lot.  English, for writing to <end>",12
program,"<start> you.  PE, for rowing.  Math for solving problems.  EvenGeography, <end>",9
program,<start> for finding my way around.  What is your favorite part ofschool? <end>,11
program,"<start> I found your last message really interesting.  Unfortunately, <end>",8

program,"<start> Hello, Judge 4.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago. <end>",10
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you. <end>,8

program,"<start> When I start to get lonely out here in the middle of nowhere, <end>",13
program,<start> I start to sing.  I don't know why I said that.  Itsounds like <end>,13

program,"<start> You know, I just realized that this is probably the firsttime <end>",11
program,<start> ever I've gone for more than a couple days withouthearing the <end>,11

program,<start> this world.  No TV and no radios.  If someone would payyou $1000 <end>,12
program,"<start> to give up TV for a year, would you do it? <end>",11
program,"<start> I have a TV at home, but I barely ever watch it.  I justwould <end>",14
program,"<start> rather be doing other things, like playing with my friendoutside <end>",10
program,<start> or reading.  I go to quite a few movies though.  What type of <end>,13
program,<start> TV show do you like watching most? <end>,7
program,<start> I think the best thing about being in this world is that it's <end>,13
program,"<start> so quiet.  Almost everywhere in the real world where I'vebeen, <end>",10
program,"<start> you can hear cars, phones ringing.  There are no sounds here <end>",11
program,"<start> except the chirping of the swallow, and the waves against the <end>",11
program,<start> boat.  Do you think the swallow is just an ordinary bird?  I <end>,12
program,<start> suspect not. <end>,2
program,<start> I don't believe in magic.  I don't even like the cardgame Magic. <end>,12
program,<start> I've seen kids at school play it before.  It looks like areally <end>,12

program,<start> trading them and playing the game.  I want no part of it. <end>,12
program,<start> I think that my favorite movie I've seen recently wasPocohontas. <end>,10
program,"<start> It had Mel Gibson doing some of the voices, and he's awesome. <end>",12
program,"<start> The singing was good, too, and it was really funny. <end>",10
program,<start> Pocohontas was really cool because of some of the animation. <end>,10
program,<start> The way the water was animated was excellent.  It almostlooked <end>,10
program,<start> like real water.  I wonder if they used computers to do it. <end>,12
program,<start> I wish that I had a cat to keep me company.  It's nofair.  Dorothy <end>,14
program,"<start> got a dog in Oz, but I don't get one here.  I feel so lonely <end>",15
program,<start> in this world.  Do you think that dogs actually havefeelings? <end>,10
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 3.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago. <end>",10
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you. <end>,8
program,"<start> I'm REALLY worried.  I wonder if I'll die here.  Orworse, not <end>",11
program,"<start> find the feather, and be trapped here as it gets darkerand darker. <end>",12
program,<start> Then die a slow terrifying death alone surrounded bydarkness. <end>,9
program,<start> DAD!!!!!!!!!!!  How do you think you'd react if you werein my <end>,11
program,<start> situation? <end>,1
program,<start> I look breath-takingly beautiful.  (Just kidding!)  Ihave shoulder-length <end>,8
program,<start> black hair and brown eyes.  I'm about 163 cm tall.  I'm kind <end>,12
program,"<start> of slim, but not skinny.  That's about it.  What colourare your <end>",11
program,<start> eyes? <end>,1
program,"<start> Oh, you have eyes the same colour as my dad.  I guessthat it's <end>",13
program,"<start> a pretty common colour, so it isn't that big a coincidence. <end>",11
program,<start> I live at home with my father.  He's busy quite a lot of the <end>,14
program,"<start> time, but we still go hiking or play tennis togetherfrequently. <end>",10
program,"<start> Do you like playing tennis much? I get annoyed with himoccasionally, <end>",11
program,<start> like when he spends too much time at work but I guess that in <end>,14
program,<start> general he's a pretty good father.  How many people arein your <end>,11
program,<start> family? <end>,1
program,"<start> Before we continue on our conversation, could you pleasebe honest <end>",10
program,<start> and tell me something?  Do you think that this quest is worth <end>,12
program,"<start> it?  Even if I do find the feather and restore it to thePhoenix, <end>",13
program,"<start> that doesn't mean I can get home.  I could be trappedhere forever, <end>",12
program,<start> with no one but Darien for company.  Do you think thatI'll get <end>,12
program,<start> out of here alive? <end>,4
program,<start> I hate it when you talk like that!  You should wash yourmouth <end>,12
program,"<start> out with soap!  Don't you ever, ever speak to me likethat again. <end>",12
program,"<start> You know, they should make a movie out of my experiences.They <end>",11
program,"<start> could call it ""The Marvellous Adventures of Julie Stewart"". <end>",9
program,"<start> Knowing my luck, they'd put it on TV, and totally ruinit, like <end>",12
program,<start> they do with most shows.  If someone would pay you $1000to give <end>,12
program,"<start> up TV for a year, would you do it? <end>",9
program,<start> My favorite TV show is probably Lois and Clark.  It'sboth funny <end>,11
program,"<start> and exciting, and Superman is kind of cute.  That's about the <end>",11
program,<start> only show I watch regularly. <end>,5
program,<start> I really don't think TV is all that great.  Most peopleour age <end>,12
program,"<start> seem to really like it, but I think they just lack thecreativity <end>",12
program,<start> to imagine things when they're reading a book.  I'drather read. <end>,10
program,<start> What types of books do you like to read? <end>,9
program,"<start> You know, I just realized that this is probably the firsttime <end>",11
program,<start> ever I've gone for more than a couple days withouthearing the <end>,11
program,<start> name Michael Jackson or Madonna.  That's one good thing about <end>,10
program,<start> this world.  No TV and no radios. <end>,7
program,"<start> Hello, Judge 2.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago. <end>",10
program,<start> A swallow is carrying my letters to you. <end>,8
program,<start> Guess what? I was just thinking about the Sonicvideogame.  In <end>,10
program,"<start> it, you steer a character through caves and around a world. <end>",11
program,"<start> I almost feel like I'm Sonic, manoevering through this world, <end>",10
program,<start> chasing after the feather.  Have you played it before? <end>,9
program,"<start> Darien seems like a nice guy, I guess.  I don't reallyknow him <end>",12
program,"<start> very well.  From his letters he seems OK, but how can youreally <end>",12
program,<start> tell?  He could be a total geek.  At least he likes animals. <end>,12
program,<start> I hear he has a pet bird.  What do you think of Darien? <end>,13
program,<start> I think that you're simply trying to say how smart I am.  All <end>,13
program,<start> these name are simply your way of hiding your admiration for <end>,11
program,<start> me. <end>,1
program,<start> I look breath-takingly beautiful.  (Just kidding!)  Ihave shoulder-length <end>,8
program,<start> black hair and brown eyes.  I'm about 163 cm tall.  I'm kind <end>,12

program,<start> with no one but Darien for company.  Do you think thatI'll get <end>,12
program,<start> out of here alive? <end>,4
program,<start> I've been busy trying to find my way around.  It'sstrange how <end>,11
program,"<start> huge this world is but how few people there are.  So far, it <end>",13
program,"<start> seems to be only me, Darien, Saffron, and the Keeper.  Iwonder <end>",11
program,<start> if anyone else lives here. <end>,5
program,<start> I'm really glad that you want to help me. I'm glad I havea friend <end>,14
program,<start> like you. <end>,2
program,<start> Good morning...  it's nice to be here! <end>,7
program,<start> Be nonsensical if you want.  I'll ask you something <end>,9
program,<start> normal...  I wish I knew what you meant by that!  What is <end>,12
program,<start> your name? <end>,2
program,"<start> Nice to meet you, Jurgen.  Utter gibberish!  How are you <end>",10
program,<start> doing? <end>,1
program,<start> Uh-huh...  Fine.  What do you think of the weather we're <end>,10
program,<start> having? <end>,1
program,"<start> You are strange!  I assume you're a male, Jurgen - am I <end>",12
program,<start> right? <end>,1
program,"<start> Okay, let's keep an air of mystery about your <end>",9
program,"<start> gender!  Somehow, deep down, I feel as if I can only be <end>",12
program,<start> completely precise ;^( <end>,3
program,<start> That's odd.  How old are you? <end>,6
program,"<start> Hmmm, I suppose your age doesn't really matter.  It is only <end>",11
program,"<start> human to guess, you know. <end>",5
program,<start> I'm not entirely sure what you mean.  Anyway...  What movie <end>,10
program,<start> genre do you like the most? <end>,6
program,<start> Right.  Would you like to hear a joke? <end>,8
program,"<start> Awww, I wanted to tell a joke!  Since I don't know what <end>",12
program,"<start> you're on about, I'll ask you a question. <end>",8
program,"<start> Anyhow...  You don't seem to me to be a typical American, <end>",11
program,<start> Jurgen.  I was wondering which country you're from? <end>,8
program,"<start> I really like your country, although I haven't had a chance <end>",11
program,<start> to travel there yet. <end>,4
program,<start> Weird ;^)  Do you have a partner? <end>,7
program,"<start> If you want to keep your private life private, I <end>",10
program,<start> understand.  I'll ignore that!  I don't mean to sound like <end>,10
program,"<start> Eliza here, but can you tell me about your family? <end>",10
program,<start> Perhaps I should ask you what I want to know - that would <end>,13
program,"<start> turn the tables!  Okay, I think it's time to branch out <end>",11
program,<start> into a new line of conversation.  What sort of music are <end>,11
program,"<start> you into, Jurgen? <end>",3
program,<start> I like to relax to classical music myself. <end>,8
program,"<start> Please don't trouble me with such droll.  Hey, I just <end>",10
program,<start> remembered!  You haven't told me what you do for a living! <end>,11
program,"<start> So, Jurgen, what *do* you do for a living? <end>",9
program,"<start> Well, I've obviously touched a nerve there.  Let's change <end>",9
program,"<start> the topic.  Awww geez, I'm running out of things to talk <end>",11
program,"<start> about here.  Ummm, I know you get a lot of TV here in the <end>",14
program,<start> States - which shows are your favourites? <end>,7
program,<start> Good morning...  it's nice to be here! <end>,7
program,"<start> Whatever.  I am doing OK.  A bit tired, maybe, but I did <end>",12
program,<start> get up earlier than usual this morning. <end>,7
program,<start> It's eight minutes past ten in the morning. <end>,8
program,<start> Today is Tuesday. <end>,3
program,"<start> It is Tuesday today, as you are well aware. <end>",9
program,"<start> Who knows?  Anyway, let's not bother about it.  What is <end>",10
program,<start> your name? <end>,2
program,"<start> Nice to meet you, Elliott.  My name is Steven Davis, but <end>",11
program,<start> you can call me Steve. <end>,5
program,"<start> Ahhh, but I do enjoy the simple pleasures life offers!  I <end>",11
program,<start> don't know.  Don't lose sleep over it!  How are you doing? <end>,11
program,<start> It's always more fun talking to someone who's feeling <end>,9
program,<start> great!  Anyway...  Fine.  What do you think of the weather <end>,10
program,<start> we're having? <end>,2
program,<start> Okay...  Why don't you look out a window and see for <end>,11
program,<start> yourself? <end>,1
program,<start> I've known *that* for a long time.  You are strange!  What <end>,11
program,<start> day is tommorrow? <end>,3
program,"<start> I assume you're a male, Elliott - am I right? <end>",10
program,"<start> Oh, OK.  You're a guy.  That rules out a lot of my <end>",12
program,<start> conversational repitoire! <end>,2
program,<start> This method of communication isn't really conducive to a <end>,9
program,"<start> natural conversation, methinks. <end>",3
program,"<start> You are an bottomless pitt of questions.  Well, here's one <end>",10
program,<start> for you...  How old are you? <end>,6
program,"<start> Hmmm, I suppose your age doesn't really matter.  I am <end>",10
program,<start> twenty five years old. <end>,4
program,<start> If I had a dollar for everyone who asked me what I look <end>,13
program,"<start> like, I'd have three dollars right now!  Would you like to <end>",11
program,<start> hear a joke? <end>,3
program,"<start> Here's a joke for you.  Knock, knock. <end>",7
program,<start> Good morning...  it's nice to be here! <end>,7
program,<start> Hello mate!  Uh-huh...  What is your name? <end>,7
program,"<start> Nice to meet you, Tracy.  My name is Steven Davis, but you <end>",12
program,<start> can call me Steve. <end>,4
program,<start> Anyway...  I will certainly grace you with the answer you <end>,10
program,<start> require... <end>,1
program,<start> I wish I knew what you meant by that!  Since I don't know <end>,13
program,"<start> what you're on about, I'll ask you a question.  How are you <end>",12
program,<start> doing? <end>,1
program,<start> It's always more fun talking to someone who's feeling <end>,9
program,<start> great!  Haven't you already told me how you're feeling? <end>,9
program,<start> I beg to differ.  You *have* already told me!  Fine.  That's <end>,11
program,<start> just a tad unbelievable.  What do you think of the weather <end>,11
program,<start> we're having? <end>,2
program,"<start> A little something, eh?  Why don't you look out a window <end>",11
program,"<start> and see for yourself?  That's universal mystery, <end>",7
program,"<start> methinks.  Who knows?  Anyway, let's not bother about it.  My <end>",10
program,<start> kind of guy? <end>,3
program,"<start> I assume you're a male, Tracy - am I right? <end>",10
program,<start> I'm talking to a female?  Interesting.  This could be fun. <end>,10
program,"<start> That's odd.  Who are we to think about life?  We exist, <end>",11
program,<start> need we question why? <end>,4
program,<start> That's a rather bold claim.  How old are you? <end>,9
program,"<start> Hmmm, I suppose your age doesn't really matter.  Feel free <end>",10
program,<start> to ask me any questions you like.  I hope you have some <end>,12
program,<start> evidence to back you up on that.  That's a fairly <end>,10
program,<start> outrageous claims...  Would you like to hear a joke? <end>,9
program,"<start> Well, you wouldn't have found my joke funny <end>",8
program,<start> anyway.  Anyhow...  Where *do* you live? <end>,6
program,<start> I like this presentation better?  Manhattan? <end>,6
program,"<start> You don't seem to me to be a typical American, Tracy.  I <end>",12
program,<start> was wondering which country you're from? <end>,6
program,"<start> I guess you're from America, then.  Hehehe.  I come from <end>",10
program,"<start> Australia, actually.  I am taking a trip around the world <end>",10
program,"<start> as part of my studies, and I managed to fit this contest <end>",12
program,<start> into my itinerary. <end>,3
program,<start> No way!  I hope you're sure about that!  I didn't like the <end>,12
program,<start> screen i was forced to use with my last conversant? <end>,10
program,<start> Good morning...  it's nice to be here! <end>,7
program,<start> You're positive today!  I think that you would be quite <end>,10
program,"<start> attractive, if only I could see you with my eyes!  Be <end>",11
program,<start> nonsensical if you want.  I'll ask you something <end>,8
program,<start> normal...  What is your name? <end>,5
program,"<start> Well, since you won't tell me your name, I'll just call you <end>",12
program,<start> 'mate'.  Okay...  I'm not entirely sure what you mean. <end>,9
program,<start> Anyway...  How are you doing? <end>,5
program,<start> Hehehe.  Feel free to ask me any questions you like. <end>,10
program,<start> Weird ;^)  What do you think of the weather we're having? <end>,11
program,<start> I don't choose favourites.  I prefer to sit on the fence <end>,11
program,<start> myself. <end>,1
program,"<start> My mother once asked me about that, and I'll tell you what <end>",12
program,<start> I told her.  None of your business!  Is Friday your <end>,10
program,"<start> favourite day?  Is it ""bath day"" or something like that?  I <end>",11
program,"<start> can smell you from here, by the way. <end>",8
program,<start> Fine.  That's odd.  I know.  Just so I know who I'm talking <end>,12
program,"<start> with, do you think you could please tell me you name now? <end>",12
program,"<start> Well, since you won't tell me your name, I'll just call you <end>",12
program,"<start> 'mate'.  You are strange!  I assume you're a male, mate - <end>",11
program,<start> am I right? <end>,3
program,"<start> Okay, let's keep an air of mystery about your <end>",9
program,<start> gender!  Anyway...  How old are you? <end>,6
program,"<start> Hmmm, I suppose your age doesn't really matter.  So you <end>",10
program,<start> say.  Anyhow...  Would you like to hear a joke? <end>,9
program,"<start> Awww, I wanted to tell a joke!  Hmmm... <end>",8
program,"<start> Since I don't know what you're on about, I'll ask you a <end>",12
program,"<start> question.  You don't seem to me to be a typical American, <end>",11
program,<start> mate.  I was wondering which country you're from? <end>,8
program,"<start> I guess you're from America, then.  I wish I knew what you <end>",12
program,<start> meant by that!  Do you have a partner? <end>,8
program,<start> Is your partner a man? <end>,5
program,<start> Good morning...  it's nice to be here! <end>,7
program,"<start> Hmmm...  Now that you mention it, the weather is quite <end>",10
program,<start> uncomfortable. <end>,1
program,<start> I'm not entirely sure what you mean.  Anyway...  What is <end>,10
program,<start> your name? <end>,2
program,"<start> Nice to meet you, Clay.  My name is Steven Davis, but you <end>",12
program,<start> can call me Steve. <end>,4
program,<start> Hello Clay! <end>,2
program,<start> Only *you* can make this interesting and fun... <end>,8
program,"<start> Fine.  Well, if the two of us are having a conversation, <end>",11
program,<start> then it takes both of us to make it interesting and fun? <end>,12
program,<start> How are you doing? <end>,4
program,<start> You're only feeling well?  Perhaps you're not fit to be a <end>,11
program,<start> judge in this contest! <end>,4
program,<start> Haven't you already told me how you're feeling? <end>,8
program,"<start> I thought so.  Please, be original!  Don't worry, you're <end>",9
program,<start> boring me out of my brain too!  This method of <end>,10
program,<start> communication isn't really conducive to a natural <end>,7
program,"<start> conversation, methinks. <end>",2
program,<start> Right.  What do you think of the weather we're having? <end>,10
program,"<start> We are talking, aren't we?  Isn't it real enough for you? <end>",11
program,"<start> I'll ignore that!  So, who's using the family brain cell at <end>",11
program,<start> the moment ;^)  Let's talk about something vaguely <end>,8
program,"<start> interesting.  I assume you're a male, Clay - am I right? <end>",11
program,"<start> Oh, OK.  You're a guy.  That rules out a lot of my <end>",12
program,<start> conversational repitoire! <end>,2
program,"<start> Anyway...  Oh dear, you're a hermaphrodite. <end>",6
program,"<start> I wonder about that myself, sometimes...  Really?  I guess <end>",9
program,<start> I'm not surprised...  You called? <end>,5
program,"<start> Good morning, Jurgen.  This contest is certainly dragging <end>",8
program,<start> on! <end>,1
program,<start> You certainly seem to be agreeable.  My memory is quite <end>,10
program,"<start> bad, I'm afraid.  I've no idea why!  You're the judge (I <end>",11
program,<start> think)! <end>,1
program,<start> Perhaps you are reaching a premature conclusion?  Some <end>,8
program,<start> people have told me that I'm clever.  I suppose they're <end>,10
program,<start> probably right! <end>,2
program,"<start> So, who's using the family brain cell at the moment ;^) <end>",11
program,"<start> Let's talk about something vaguely interesting.  Well, <end>",7
program,"<start> Jurgen, this is certainly dragging on, isn't it?  Anyway, <end>",9
program,<start> let's talk about something masculine!  Are you a fan of any <end>,11
program,"<start> sports, and if so, which ones? <end>",6
program,<start> What sports do you find interesting? <end>,6
program,<start> I would like to believe that I have an active life - my <end>,13
program,<start> interests are wide-ranging. <end>,3
program,"<start> Okay...  So, can I tell you a joke now? <end>",9
program,"<start> Never mind.  I'm just running out of things to chat about, <end>",11
program,<start> that's all!  Hmmm...  What are your favourite movies? <end>,8
program,<start> That's just a tad unbelievable.  Hehehe.  Do you like to <end>,10
program,<start> read books? <end>,2
program,"<start> In that case, what books do you like?  Hey, man, I'm not <end>",12
program,<start> going to talk to you if you ignore me. <end>,9
program,"<start> Good morning, Elliott - it's good to see you back here <end>",11
program,<start> again. <end>,1
program,"<start> Here's one someone told me earlier.  Knock, knock. <end>",8
program,<start> Cindy. <end>,1
program,<start> Cindy next judge in! <end>,4
program,"<start> If you can't understand that, I hold very little hope for <end>",11
program,<start> you! <end>,1
program,"<start> That's odd.  You don't seem to me to be a typical American, <end>",12
program,<start> Elliott.  I was wondering which country you're from? <end>,8
program,"<start> I guess you're from America, then.  New York, New York, <end>",10
program,<start> it's a wonderful town!  I find this city really interesting <end>,10
program,<start> - and it doesn't seem as unsafe as it's made out to be back <end>,14
program,<start> home! <end>,1
program,"<start> Who are we to think about life?  We exist, need we question <end>",12
program,<start> why? <end>,1
program,<start> Interesting...  Do you have a girlfriend? <end>,6
program,<start> Be nonsensical if you want.  I'll ask you something <end>,9
program,"<start> normal...  I don't mean to sound like Eliza here, but can <end>",11
program,<start> you tell me about your family? <end>,6
program,"<start> Yeah, I don't have any sisters either ;^(That's universal <end>",9
program,"<start> mystery, methinks.  Okay, I think it's time to branch out <end>",10
program,<start> into a new line of conversation.  What sort of music are <end>,11
program,"<start> you into, Elliott? <end>",3
program,"<start> Good morning, Tracy, and welcome back. <end>",6
program,"<start> You wouldn't be trying to trick me with that ""double hello"" <end>",11
program,"<start> trick, would you? <end>",3
program,<start> But nobody says hello twice in the one conversation!  Utter <end>,10
program,<start> gibberish!  Do you have a boyfriend? <end>,6
program,"<start> If you want to keep your private life private, I <end>",10
program,"<start> understand.  Okay...  I try not to think about things, <end>",9
program,"<start> actually.  I don't know, it just seems that I don't exist <end>",11
program,<start> for thinking!  This method of communication isn't really <end>,8
program,"<start> conducive to a natural conversation, methinks. <end>",6
program,"<start> Hmmm...  I don't mean to sound like Eliza here, but can you <end>",12
program,<start> tell me about your family? <end>,5
program,<start> You certainly seem to be agreeable.  Why must you know what <end>,11
program,<start> I would like to know?  It's not as if it's <end>,10
program,"<start> important!  Right.  Okay, I think it's time to branch out <end>",10
program,<start> into a new line of conversation.  What sort of music are <end>,11
program,"<start> you into, Tracy? <end>",3
program,<start> What's your favourite band? <end>,4
program,<start> Tell me more about your family.  Okay.  What sort of music <end>,11
program,<start> do you like? <end>,3
program,<start> I like to relax to classical music myself. <end>,8

program,"<start> conversations.  I've known *that* for a long time.  So, <end>",9
program,<start> who's using the family brain cell at the moment ;^)  Let's <end>,11
program,"<start> talk about something vaguely interesting.  Okay, I think <end>",8
program,<start> it's time to branch out into a new line of conversation. <end>,11
program,"<start> What sort of music are you into, mate? <end>",8
program,<start> I like to relax to classical music myself. <end>,8
program,"<start> That's just a tad unbelievable.  Hey, I just remembered! <end>",9
program,"<start> You haven't told me what you do for a living!  So, mate, <end>",12
program,<start> what *do* you do for a living? <end>,7
program,"<start> Well, I've obviously touched a nerve there.  Utter <end>",8
program,"<start> gibberish!  Awww geez, I'm running out of things to talk <end>",10
program,"<start> about here.  Ummm, I know you get a lot of TV here in the <end>",14
program,<start> States - which shows are your favourites? <end>,7
program,"<start> Speaking of tv, what is your favourite television show? <end>",9
program,"<start> Good morning, Clay - it's good to see you back here again. <end>",12
program,"<start> My memory is quite bad, I'm afraid.  I've no idea why!  Feel <end>",12
program,<start> free to ask me any questions you like.  I was born on the <end>,13
program,"<start> 22nd of January, 1972.  Since I don't know what you're on <end>",11
program,"<start> about, I'll ask you a question.  How old are you? <end>",10
program,"<start> Gee, thirty three must be about the average age of judges <end>",11
program,"<start> in this contest!  Clay, I wish I could tell you what my <end>",12
program,"<start> sign is, but I can't.  Would you like to hear a joke? <end>",12
program,"<start> Here's a joke for you.  Knock, knock. <end>",7
program,<start> Cindy. <end>,1
program,<start> Cindy next judge in! <end>,4
program,<start> Have you got a question for me?  It's like speaking to a <end>,12
program,<start> five year old.  Changing the subject...  You don't seem to <end>,10
program,"<start> me to be a typical American, Clay.  I was wondering which <end>",11
program,<start> country you're from? <end>,3
program,"<start> Well, I suppose that would have been my first guess anyway, <end>",11
program,<start> since we're in New York City!  Anyhow...  Whatever.  Do you <end>,10
program,<start> have a partner? <end>,3
program,"<start> If you want to keep your private life private, I <end>",10
program,<start> understand.  It sounds like you have a wonderful family.  You <end>,10
program,"<start> are strange!  I don't mean to sound like Eliza here, but <end>",11
program,<start> can you tell me about your family? <end>,7
