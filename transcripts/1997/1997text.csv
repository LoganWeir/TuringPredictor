program,No.... Have you had your car broken into or vandalized.
program,"OK, yes on balance. - Has real violent crime affected you"
program,in in another way?
program,Was anyone charged with it in court?
program,So often theres no psycholgically satisfactory conclusion.
program,"Did you feel violated by all this, or not?"
program,"Hello, Judge 1.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,"I'm Julie Stewart.  I'm a 14 year old girl who lives inSooke,"
program,but is currently trapped in the Phoenix Archipelago.  I'm in
program,the ninth grade.  My best friends are Karen and Nick.  Ienjoy
program,"tennis and chess, but I have other interests too.  Do youlike"
program,playing tennis much?
program,I can't believe that you don't like tennis!  It's a greatgame.
program,"It's very fast paced.  You have to be a fast runner, and have"
program,"really good reflexes, but you also need a good strategy.I think"
program,"that's why Karen, Nick and I play it so much."
program,Remarkable.  The swallow's actually taken the letter tosomeone
program,"smart, who thinks chess is a good game.  I'll have to give it"
program,a worm when it comes back.  (Yuck!  That means I'll haveto pick
program,up the slimy thingy with my fingers!)  I'd ask you to play a
program,"game, but I don't have a board."
program,Nick is one of my friends from school.  We play chess a lot.
program,I'm better than him.  He's a bit too competitive; he tends to
program,be a sore loser whenever I beat him.  He finds itdifficult to
program,admit that I'm better than him.
program,"Yes, Karen is a pretty neat person.  She's so talented.  She"
program,is pretty good at history at school (although I'm better than
program,"her at math).  She's also good at sports, especiallyvolleyball"
program,and tennis.  What do you like best about your friends?
program,"In the real world, two of my friends are Karen and Nick.Karen's"
program,is my best friend.  We spend a lot of our free time together.
program,"Nick is a guy who I spend some time with, playing tennis and"
program,chess.  Darien seems OK too.
program,"I really enjoy playing tennis.  I'm pretty good at it, too."
program,"(How humble!)  I play with my friend Karen quite often,and occasionally"
program,with Nick.  Karen and I are about even.  Nick is a bit worse
program,"than me, I think."
program,"Darien seems like a nice guy, I guess.  I don't really know"
program,"him very well.  From his letters he seems OK, but how can you"
program,really tell?  He could be a total geek.  At least helikes animals.
program,I hear he has a pet bird.  What do you think of Darien?
program,I don't know much about him; only from letters.  I'drather talk
program,about something else that I would find more interesting.  How
program,about school?  What is your favorite part of school?
program,I don't like tests not because I do badly or anything.  Ijust
program,"kind of get nervous about them.  I mean, I always try todo my"
program,"best at school, and I really hate it if I do poorly on atest."
program,"Sometimes it isn't even my fault when I don't do well,the test"
program,is just too hard but I still feel bad about them.  Then I go
program,and beat Nick at tennis and I feel better!  What do you like
program,least about school?
program,"I'm REALLY worried.  I wonder if I'll die here.  Orworse, not"
program,"find the feather, and be trapped here as it gets darkerand darker."
program,Then die a slow terrifying death alone surrounded bydarkness.
program,DAD!!!!!!!!!!!  How do you think you'd react if you werein my
program,situation?
program,There are lots of islands around here.  It is an archipelago.
program,I think that Darien mentioned that he was on the Islandof the
program,"Sun, whatever that is.  He probably knows more about it than"
program,me.
program,"The archipelago would be a fairly nice place for a vacation,"
program,if it weren't so cold here.  I imagine that after the Phoenix
program,"gets its feather back, it will be really a wonderful place."
program,It has beautiful water and tropical islands.  What do youthink
program,the Phoenix looks like?
program,I look breath-takingly beautiful.  (Just kidding!)  Ihave shoulder-length
program,black hair and brown eyes.  I'm about 163 cm tall.  I'm kind
program,"of slim, but not skinny.  That's about it.  What colourare your"
program,eyes?
program,I don't believe you.  There is no way that you could possibly
program,"know where the feather is.  You're in the real world, like my"
program,"dad and the rest of my friends, and the feather is here.  I'm"
program,not going to waste my time playing such games.
program,"It's strange, but right now I really miss reading.  Ifind that"
program,"whenever I spend a few days without opening a book, I tend to"
program,want to read again.  Even read one of those boring novelsfrom
program,English class.  What types of books do you like to read?
program,I didn't understand your last message entirely... I'lljust tell
program,you what I've been daydreaming about.  I was imagining myself
program,lying on my bed in my room.  Sigh.  What a comfortablethought.
program,"But there's no point in dreaming now, I've got a quest tofinish."
program,"Hello, Judge 5.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,I wish that I'd thought to bring along a change of clothes.
program,Mine are so dirty and torn up right now.  Not that that'smuch
program,"of a problem, except that the world is getting cold and dark,"
program,and I'm getting cold too.  As cold as death.  Do you wearreally
program,fashionable clothes?
program,I bet that you're really good looking.  I think you'rekind of
program,"like one of those people who knows that they look good,but doesn't"
program,"brag about it, or pretend that they're better than anyoneelse."
program,What colour are your eyes?
program,"I'm Julie Stewart.  I'm a 14 year old girl who lives inSooke,"
program,but is currently trapped in the Phoenix Archipelago.  I'm in
program,the ninth grade.  My best friends are Karen and Nick.  Ienjoy
program,"tennis and chess, but I have other interests too.  Do youlike"
program,playing tennis much?
program,"I found your last message really interesting.  Unfortunately,"
program,I don't have time to respond directly to it at themoment.  I'll
program,write back later.
program,I've got to hurry and restore the feather to the Phoenix.  At
program,"night, it seems so dark, almost like the dark is closingin and"
program,trying to smother me.  I don't know if I'll ever escape this
program,place.  Please hurry and help me get through this trek.  What
program,do you think the Phoenix looks like?
program,"You know, they should make a movie out of my experiences.They"
program,"could call it ""The Marvellous Adventures of Julie Stewart""."
program,"Knowing my luck, they'd put it on TV, and totally ruinit, like"
program,they do with most shows.  If someone would pay you $1000to give
program,"up TV for a year, would you do it?"
program,I hate it when you talk like that!  You should wash yourmouth
program,"out with soap!  Don't you ever, ever speak to me likethat again."
program,Could you help me out here?  There is so much about thisworld
program,that I don't understand.  Time seems to have stopped orsomething
program,because my watch isn't working anymore.  People seem tosuddenly
program,appear out of nowhere.  What's going on?
program,"In this world, it is fairly cool, and rather damp.  Ithink that"
program,"this place would be warmer if the phoenix had itsfeather, because"
program,many of the plants around here are tropical.  Other than the
program,"cold, it wouldn't be a bad vacation spot."
program,"Well, when I first fell into the Phoenix Archipelago, I heard"
program,a voice whispering: I've passed through the time beyond time.
program,"Exactly what that means, I have no idea.  So I don't knowexactly"
program,where I am.  I'm trying to escape from this place and go back
program,"home.  Will you help me, 05?"
program,I'm really glad that you're willing to help me out.  Thisquest
program,would be almost impossible without your help.
program,"You know, I just realized that this is probably the firsttime"
program,ever I've gone for more than a couple days withouthearing the
program,name Michael Jackson or Madonna.  That's one good thing about
program,this world.  No TV and no radios.  What type of TV showdo you
program,like watching most?
program,I'm not at all happy that you don't want to help me.  I want
program,"to survive this adventure, and your help would mean a lot to"
program,me.
program,"I live in Sooke, on Vancouver Island, in BritishColumbia, Canada,"
program,"with my father.  I live with my aunt occasionally, also.  She"
program,lives in Sooke too.  We have a typical house in a typicalneighbourhood.
program,What's it like to live where you do?
program,"Well, you have to look for power words in the Journal,and click"
program,on them.  You can tell if a word is a power word because the
program,mouse pointer turns into a feather.  Clicking on power words
program,"will reveal more of the journal, or maybe puzzles on the map."
program,"If you play puzzles multiple times, you might get more pieces"
program,"of the journal, too!"
program,"I don't know much about the journal.  After all, Saffron gave"
program,"the journal to you, not to me.  But from what Iunderstand, the"
program,"journal contains some sort of power, built into thewords.  You"
program,should talk to Saffron about it.
program,Hey.  What if I starting talking to you like that?  Youwouldn't
program,"like it very much either, I bet.  If you do it again I don't"
program,think I'll like you any more.
program,I'm not quite certain who Saffron is or what she does.  She's
program,"someone that I can write to, and I think that you cantoo.  Saffron"
program,seems to talk in riddles a lot of the time.  I find herrather
program,confusing.  What do you think of Saffron?
program,"Sorry to cut through our little conversation, but I'vebeen wondering"
program,about somethings.  It's strange how the boat was conveniently
program,located where I came out of the cave.  And how theswallow found
program,me.  And how I started getting letters out of no where.I wonder
program,if this is just some sort of obscure plan.  By the Keeperperhaps.
program,Or Saffron.  Maybe Darien.  What do you think?
program,"Hello, Judge 2.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,"Hello, Judge 4.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,I'm totally glad that the swallow is here.  I'd have realproblems
program,"without it.  I'd be all alone, in the middle of nowhere, with"
program,"no communication with anyone.  At least I can talk toyou, Darien,"
program,"Saffron, and the Keeper.  How do you think the swallow isable"
program,to carry postcards between the archipelago and the realworld?
program,"The archipelago would be a fairly nice place for a vacation,"
program,if it weren't so cold here.  I imagine that after the Phoenix
program,"gets its feather back, it will be really a wonderful place."
program,It has beautiful water and tropical islands.  What do youthink
program,the Phoenix looks like?
program,The Keeper said that the feather is a tail feather of thePhoenix.
program,"It is supposed to be golden, despite the fact that thePhoenix"
program,"is Red.  I think the plan is that I find the feather, get it"
program,"to the Phoenix, along with the Guardians, and the universe is"
program,saved.  Seems pretty easy....  Why do you think themissing feather
program,is so important to the Phoenix?
program,"This archipelago is a strange land.  If it weren't foryour letters,"
program,"and the swallow's company, I think I'd go insane.  Sometimes"
program,I'm so lonely that I sing to myself just to hear a voice.
program,"I don't have the feather yet, but I suspect that I'm getting"
program,close.  Or maybe it's just that I'm really hopeful thatI'm getting
program,"close, because it's getting darker and darker here every day."
program,But I still haven't found it yet.
program,I have no idea where the feather is.  That was the wholepoint
program,"of this quest.  Find the feather, save the universe, all that"
program,"sort of thing.  But right now, I have no clue of wherethe feather"
program,is.
program,"Well, you have to look for power words in the Journal,and click"
program,on them.  You can tell if a word is a power word because the
program,mouse pointer turns into a feather.  Clicking on power words
program,"will reveal more of the journal, or maybe puzzles on the map."
program,"If you play puzzles multiple times, you might get more pieces"
program,"of the journal, too!"
program,"To find the journal, you have to click on one of thesmall buttons"
program,on the upper right side of the screen.
program,"In the real world, two of my friends are Karen and Nick.Karen's"
program,is my best friend.  We spend a lot of our free time together.
program,"Nick is a guy who I spend some time with, playing tennis and"
program,chess.  Darien seems OK too.  Do you like playing tennismuch?
program,"I don't know much about the journal.  After all, Saffron gave"
program,"the journal to you, not to me.  But from what Iunderstand, the"
program,"journal contains some sort of power, built into thewords.  You"
program,should talk to Saffron about it.
program,I'm not quite sure what Saffron's role is in all of this.  I
program,"mean, she just kind of conveniently comes out of nowhereto send"
program,"a letter.  I know so little about her, and it makes menervous."
program,What do you think of Saffron?
program,Something is stuck on my mind right now.  I wonder whatNick's
program,"doing right now.  Probably wondering if I'm ever coming back,"
program,"and if I don't, whether he can have my music collectionand my"
program,bike.
program,"I like soft rock music, like Phil Collins.  I don't like most"
program,"other types of music, like heavy metal, classical, jazz,blues,"
program,"country, dance, or rap.  And I definitely don't like theopera"
program,music that my dad plays sometime.  Yuck!  What is yourfavorite
program,type of music?
program,"Hello, Judge 3.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,"Sorry, but I didn't understand everything that you talkedabout"
program,in your last message.  How about we switch the topic tosomething
program,else?  ...Don't you think that it's pretty amazing thatDarien
program,and I live so close to each other in the real world?We're within
program,about 4 hours travel of each other.  I could even visithim when
program,we get out of this mess.
program,Something has just occurred to me.  I wonder what motivations
program,Saffron and the Keeper have.  Darien's obvious.  He wants to
program,get home.  But I wonder what Saffron and the Keeper hasto gain
program,from this.
program,I'm not quite certain who Saffron is or what she does.  She's
program,"someone that I can write to, and I think that you cantoo.  Saffron"
program,seems to talk in riddles a lot of the time.  I find herrather
program,confusing.  What do you think of Saffron?
program,"I'm not sure what, or who, the Keeper keeps.  I first saw him"
program,"on Lighthouse Island, so maybe he's called the Keeper because"
program,he's a lighthouse keeper.  I'm not so sure though.  He seems
program,awfully old and frail to be a lighthouse keeper.  What do you
program,think of the Keeper?
program,"I live in Sooke, on Vancouver Island, in BritishColumbia, Canada,"
program,"with my father.  I live with my aunt occasionally, also.  She"
program,lives in Sooke too.  We have a typical house in a typicalneighbourhood.
program,What's it like to live where you do?
program,Sooke is located near Victoria on Vancouver Island.  It'sa pretty
program,"small place, but if you want to go to a city, you can just go"
program,"to Victoria.  It has the friendliness of a small town,with the"
program,benefits of a city nearby.  What is your favorite thing about
program,your house?
program,"The archipelago would be a fairly nice place for a vacation,"
program,if it weren't so cold here.  I imagine that after the Phoenix
program,"gets its feather back, it will be really a wonderful place."
program,It has beautiful water and tropical islands.  What do youthink
program,the Phoenix looks like?
program,I wish that I'd thought to bring along a change of clothes.
program,Mine are so dirty and torn up right now.  Not that that'smuch
program,"of a problem, except that the world is getting cold and dark,"
program,and I'm getting cold too.  As cold as death.  Do you wearreally
program,fashionable clothes?
program,"I generally spend most of my money on clothes.  For instance,"
program,I bought the vest I'm wearing now a few weeks ago when I was
program,"in Hong Kong.  I try to get stuff that is original,attractive,"
program,and reasonably inexpensive.  What do you usually buy when you
program,go shopping?
program,"I really enjoy reading, especially in the winter.  (Inthe summer,"
program,I'd rather play tennis outside.)  But I find that Ireally enjoy
program,reading a good novel.  Even some of the books they makeus read
program,in school are good.  (Though most of them aren't that great.)
program,What types of books do you like to read?
program,Guess what? I was just thinking about the Sonicvideogame.  In
program,"it, you steer a character through caves and around a world."
program,"I almost feel like I'm Sonic, manoevering through this world,"
program,chasing after the feather.  Have you played it before?
program,"When it comes to religion, I've always thought that it'sa very"
program,"personal thing.  Whatever someone chooses to believe in, it's"
program,"their choice, and nobody else's business.  That's all I have"
program,to say about it.
program,I miss hearing a human voice.  I miss laughing with myfriends.
program,That's the problem with Darien.  His jokes really stink.Nick
program,and Karen have way better jokes than Darien.
program,"You know, rather than being so pessimistic about thiswhole quest,"
program,maybe I should focus on the bright side of being here.  I get
program,"to do a lot of hiking and exploring.  If I get home, I'll be"
program,able to meet you and we can write a book about this.
program,"Hello, Judge 2.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,I wonder how long it will take me to get back to the realworld.
program,"Because if I'm not careful, I could run out of food.That would"
program,"be lovely, starving to death on a desert island withoutany friends."
program,Please help me finish this quest.
program,Do you know what I just saw in the sky?  Those clouds in the
program,sky formed an image that looked like a scene from Pocohontas.
program,It was the last movie I saw before I went on vacation.  Iwonder
program,if I'll ever see another movie again.
program,"I really enjoy reading, especially in the winter.  (Inthe summer,"
program,I'd rather play tennis outside.)  But I find that Ireally enjoy
program,reading a good novel.  Even some of the books they makeus read
program,in school are good.  (Though most of them aren't that great.)
program,What types of books do you like to read?
program,I like reading books where the characters have variousadventures
program,and quests that they have to solve.  I guess they kind offall
program,into the fantasy and science fiction genre.
program,"I enjoy drawing and painting, but I'm not very good.  Ireally"
program,"like it at school, but I don't do it in my spare time oranything."
program,I have other things I'd rather do.  I think if I were better
program,"at it, I'd do it more.  Do you like art or gym class more?"
program,"Darien seems like kind of an interesting person, but whoknows,"
program,he could turn out to be just a geek.  At least he'ssomeone who
program,can identify with the situation I'm in.  What do you think of
program,Darien?
program,"Darien seems like a nice guy, I guess.  I don't reallyknow him"
program,"very well.  From his letters he seems OK, but how can youreally"
program,tell?  He could be a total geek.  At least he likes animals.
program,I hear he has a pet bird.  What do you think of Darien?
program,"At least Darien has a sense of humor.  That would be theworst,"
program,being stuck in this strange world with someone whodoesn't have
program,a sense of humor.  Darien told me a couple corny jokes.So he
program,seems OK.  What do you think about Darien's opinions ofSaffron?
program,"What?  You tersely want to say nothing, and want me to write"
program,lots back to you?  Forget it!
program,I really enjoy hiking.  I like being able to explore thewilderness.
program,How often do you go hiking?  And where do you usually go?I play
program,tennis and bike quite a bit with my friends during thesummer.
program,"In the winter, I read quite a bit, and play a lot of chess."
program,Those are my main pastimes.  Do you know how to playchess very
program,well?
program,Darien is this other guy in the archipelago who I can write
program,"to.  I think that you can write to him, too.  He saysthat he's"
program,"trapped on the Island of the Sun, wherever that is.  I don't"
program,know much about him except that he likes basketball.  What do
program,you think it would be like meeting Darien?
program,I agree with you.  Hiking is really fun.  The whole ideaof leaving
program,"the city behind and seeing what the world was like,before people"
program,"screwed it up, is really fascinating."
program,There are lots of islands around here.  It is an archipelago.
program,I think that Darien mentioned that he was on the Islandof the
program,"Sun, whatever that is.  He probably knows more about it than"
program,me.
program,"Sorry I'm not saying much, but I'm really suspicious asto who"
program,"is reading our letters.  So far, I've been able to writeto you,"
program,"Saffron, Darien, and the Keeper.  But I don't know if theswallow"
program,is taking these letters to anyone else.  How do you think the
program,swallow is able to carry postcards between thearchipelago and
program,the real world?
program,So far I've been totally jinxed!  This vest is supposedto give
program,"me good luck and protect me, but it hasn't been the bestof protection."
program,"It didn't save me from falling down the hole into this world,"
program,and hurting myself.  I need a new piece of protectiveclothing.
program,Now if I can just find a store....  What do you usuallybuy when
program,you go shopping?
program,"Hello, Judge 1.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,"When I first heard about this vacation, I thought that itwould"
program,"be great!  No school, no worries, no problems.  But nowI'm in"
program,a real mess.  I wonder what my dad will think if I die.  How
program,do you think you'd react if you were in my situation?
program,I miss hearing a human voice.  I miss laughing with myfriends.
program,That's the problem with Darien.  His jokes really stink.Nick
program,and Karen have way better jokes than Darien.
program,I've got to hurry and restore the feather to the Phoenix.  At
program,"night, it seems so dark, almost like the dark is closingin and"
program,trying to smother me.  I don't know if I'll ever escape this
program,place.  Please hurry and help me get through this trek.  What
program,do you think the Phoenix looks like?
program,"Sorry, but I didn't understand everything that you talkedabout"
program,in your last message.  How about we switch the topic tosomething
program,else?  ...Don't you think that it's pretty amazing thatDarien
program,and I live so close to each other in the real world?We're within
program,about 4 hours travel of each other.  I could even visithim when
program,we get out of this mess.
program,Something just struck me.  I wonder what would have happened
program,if Darien and I hadn't fallen into this world.  Perhapsit would
program,have just been plunged into darkness without any hope ofreprieve.
program,It seems strange that we happened to come here when wewere needed.
program,"Before we continue on our conversation, could you pleasebe honest"
program,and tell me something?  Do you think that this quest is worth
program,"it?  Even if I do find the feather and restore it to thePhoenix,"
program,"that doesn't mean I can get home.  I could be trappedhere forever,"
program,with no one but Darien for company.  Do you think thatI'll get
program,out of here alive?
program,What's with that swallow?  I don't understand how it canfigure
program,"out who to send the letters to.  I could send somethingto you,"
program,and the dumb bird could take it to the Keeper instead.  That
program,would be a disaster!  How do you think the swallow is able to
program,carry postcards between the archipelago and the real world?
program,"You know, if my dad were trapped in this world, he'd probably"
program,have a laptop computer.  He carries his laptop everywherewith
program,"him.  That'd be pretty strange, being stuck in thisfantasy world,"
program,carrying a computer.  Would you rather play computer games or
program,video games?
program,"Hello, Judge 5.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,It seems like years since I last had a real meal.Sitting around
program,"a table, with my Dad and Aunt for dinner.  And talking about"
program,"whatever is interesting, my friends, what I've done, whatbooks"
program,I've read.  I'm so lonely.  What types of books do youlike to
program,read?
program,Julie Lawson is probably my favorite author.  She writesreally
program,well.  I find her characters really realistic.  They'renot stupid
program,and nice all the time like characters in other books.
program,"The archipelago would be a fairly nice place for a vacation,"
program,if it weren't so cold here.  I imagine that after the Phoenix
program,"gets its feather back, it will be really a wonderful place."
program,It has beautiful water and tropical islands.  What do youthink
program,the Phoenix looks like?
program,"While I was waiting for your last letter, I've been thinking."
program,"The real world seems so distant now, almost like a dream.  My"
program,"friends, my family, my home.  It all seems so far away.I don't"
program,think I'm ever going to get back.  I think I will die here.
program,How do you think you'd react if you were in my situation?
program,I wish that I had a cat to keep me company.  It's nofair.  Dorothy
program,"got a dog in Oz, but I don't get one here.  I feel so lonely"
program,in this world.  Do you think that dogs actually havefeelings?
program,I've never really thought about how I use stuff that I'velearned
program,"in school.  But now I've used a lot.  English, for writing to"
program,"you.  PE, for rowing.  Math for solving problems.  EvenGeography,"
program,for finding my way around.  What is your favorite part ofschool?
program,"I found your last message really interesting.  Unfortunately,"
program,I don't have time to respond directly to it at themoment.  I'll
program,write back later.
program,"I have such bad luck.  When I go biking, my bike is theone that"
program,"gets the flat tire. Where do you go biking, and withwhom? When"
program,"I go hiking, my tent is the one that collapses in therainstorm."
program,"When I go travelling, I'm the one who falls down the holeinto"
program,the Phoenix Archipelago!
program,"Hello, Judge 4.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,I really like the swallow.  It's probably the most usefulthing
program,"that I've ever found in this place.  Forget Darien, theKeeper,"
program,and Saffron; the help of this little bird is far better than
program,the help of any of them!  How do you think the swallow isable
program,to carry postcards between the archipelago and the realworld?
program,"When I start to get lonely out here in the middle of nowhere,"
program,I start to sing.  I don't know why I said that.  Itsounds like
program,some stupid line from The Sound of Music.  It's soridiculous.
program,Do you like to sing?
program,"You know, I just realized that this is probably the firsttime"
program,ever I've gone for more than a couple days withouthearing the
program,name Michael Jackson or Madonna.  That's one good thing about
program,this world.  No TV and no radios.  If someone would payyou $1000
program,"to give up TV for a year, would you do it?"
program,"I have a TV at home, but I barely ever watch it.  I justwould"
program,"rather be doing other things, like playing with my friendoutside"
program,or reading.  I go to quite a few movies though.  What type of
program,TV show do you like watching most?
program,I think the best thing about being in this world is that it's
program,"so quiet.  Almost everywhere in the real world where I'vebeen,"
program,"you can hear cars, phones ringing.  There are no sounds here"
program,"except the chirping of the swallow, and the waves against the"
program,boat.  Do you think the swallow is just an ordinary bird?  I
program,suspect not.
program,I don't believe in magic.  I don't even like the cardgame Magic.
program,I've seen kids at school play it before.  It looks like areally
program,"stupid game to me.  Kids get completely obsessed overthose cards,"
program,trading them and playing the game.  I want no part of it.
program,I think that my favorite movie I've seen recently wasPocohontas.
program,"It had Mel Gibson doing some of the voices, and he's awesome."
program,"The singing was good, too, and it was really funny."
program,Pocohontas was really cool because of some of the animation.
program,The way the water was animated was excellent.  It almostlooked
program,like real water.  I wonder if they used computers to do it.
program,I wish that I had a cat to keep me company.  It's nofair.  Dorothy
program,"got a dog in Oz, but I don't get one here.  I feel so lonely"
program,in this world.  Do you think that dogs actually havefeelings?
program,"Hello, Judge 3.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,"I'm REALLY worried.  I wonder if I'll die here.  Orworse, not"
program,"find the feather, and be trapped here as it gets darkerand darker."
program,Then die a slow terrifying death alone surrounded bydarkness.
program,DAD!!!!!!!!!!!  How do you think you'd react if you werein my
program,situation?
program,I look breath-takingly beautiful.  (Just kidding!)  Ihave shoulder-length
program,black hair and brown eyes.  I'm about 163 cm tall.  I'm kind
program,"of slim, but not skinny.  That's about it.  What colourare your"
program,eyes?
program,"Oh, you have eyes the same colour as my dad.  I guessthat it's"
program,"a pretty common colour, so it isn't that big a coincidence."
program,I live at home with my father.  He's busy quite a lot of the
program,"time, but we still go hiking or play tennis togetherfrequently."
program,"Do you like playing tennis much? I get annoyed with himoccasionally,"
program,like when he spends too much time at work but I guess that in
program,general he's a pretty good father.  How many people arein your
program,family?
program,"Before we continue on our conversation, could you pleasebe honest"
program,and tell me something?  Do you think that this quest is worth
program,"it?  Even if I do find the feather and restore it to thePhoenix,"
program,"that doesn't mean I can get home.  I could be trappedhere forever,"
program,with no one but Darien for company.  Do you think thatI'll get
program,out of here alive?
program,I hate it when you talk like that!  You should wash yourmouth
program,"out with soap!  Don't you ever, ever speak to me likethat again."
program,"You know, they should make a movie out of my experiences.They"
program,"could call it ""The Marvellous Adventures of Julie Stewart""."
program,"Knowing my luck, they'd put it on TV, and totally ruinit, like"
program,they do with most shows.  If someone would pay you $1000to give
program,"up TV for a year, would you do it?"
program,My favorite TV show is probably Lois and Clark.  It'sboth funny
program,"and exciting, and Superman is kind of cute.  That's about the"
program,only show I watch regularly.
program,I really don't think TV is all that great.  Most peopleour age
program,"seem to really like it, but I think they just lack thecreativity"
program,to imagine things when they're reading a book.  I'drather read.
program,What types of books do you like to read?
program,"You know, I just realized that this is probably the firsttime"
program,ever I've gone for more than a couple days withouthearing the
program,name Michael Jackson or Madonna.  That's one good thing about
program,this world.  No TV and no radios.
program,"Hello, Judge 2.  I've been trapped in the magical PhoenixArchipelago."
program,A swallow is carrying my letters to you.
program,Guess what? I was just thinking about the Sonicvideogame.  In
program,"it, you steer a character through caves and around a world."
program,"I almost feel like I'm Sonic, manoevering through this world,"
program,chasing after the feather.  Have you played it before?
program,"Darien seems like a nice guy, I guess.  I don't reallyknow him"
program,"very well.  From his letters he seems OK, but how can youreally"
program,tell?  He could be a total geek.  At least he likes animals.
program,I hear he has a pet bird.  What do you think of Darien?
program,I think that you're simply trying to say how smart I am.  All
program,these name are simply your way of hiding your admiration for
program,me.
program,I look breath-takingly beautiful.  (Just kidding!)  Ihave shoulder-length
program,black hair and brown eyes.  I'm about 163 cm tall.  I'm kind
program,"of slim, but not skinny.  That's about it.  What colourare your"

program,"that doesn't mean I can get home.  I could be trappedhere forever,"
program,with no one but Darien for company.  Do you think thatI'll get
program,out of here alive?
program,I've been busy trying to find my way around.  It'sstrange how
program,"huge this world is but how few people there are.  So far, it"
program,"seems to be only me, Darien, Saffron, and the Keeper.  Iwonder"
program,if anyone else lives here.
program,I'm really glad that you want to help me. I'm glad I havea friend
program,like you.
program,Good morning...  it's nice to be here!
program,Be nonsensical if you want.  I'll ask you something
program,normal...  I wish I knew what you meant by that!  What is
program,your name?
program,"Nice to meet you, Jurgen.  Utter gibberish!  How are you"
program,doing?
program,Uh-huh...  Fine.  What do you think of the weather we're
program,having?
program,"You are strange!  I assume you're a male, Jurgen - am I"
program,right?
program,"Okay, let's keep an air of mystery about your"
program,"gender!  Somehow, deep down, I feel as if I can only be"
program,completely precise ;^(
program,That's odd.  How old are you?
program,"Hmmm, I suppose your age doesn't really matter.  It is only"
program,"human to guess, you know."
program,I'm not entirely sure what you mean.  Anyway...  What movie
program,genre do you like the most?
program,Right.  Would you like to hear a joke?
program,"Awww, I wanted to tell a joke!  Since I don't know what"
program,"you're on about, I'll ask you a question."
program,"Anyhow...  You don't seem to me to be a typical American,"
program,Jurgen.  I was wondering which country you're from?
program,"I really like your country, although I haven't had a chance"
program,to travel there yet.
program,Weird ;^)  Do you have a partner?
program,"If you want to keep your private life private, I"
program,understand.  I'll ignore that!  I don't mean to sound like
program,"Eliza here, but can you tell me about your family?"
program,Perhaps I should ask you what I want to know - that would
program,"turn the tables!  Okay, I think it's time to branch out"
program,into a new line of conversation.  What sort of music are
program,"you into, Jurgen?"
program,I like to relax to classical music myself.
program,"Please don't trouble me with such droll.  Hey, I just"
program,remembered!  You haven't told me what you do for a living!
program,"So, Jurgen, what *do* you do for a living?"
program,"Well, I've obviously touched a nerve there.  Let's change"
program,"the topic.  Awww geez, I'm running out of things to talk"
program,"about here.  Ummm, I know you get a lot of TV here in the"
program,States - which shows are your favourites?
program,Good morning...  it's nice to be here!
program,"Whatever.  I am doing OK.  A bit tired, maybe, but I did"
program,get up earlier than usual this morning.
program,It's eight minutes past ten in the morning.
program,Today is Tuesday.
program,"It is Tuesday today, as you are well aware."
program,"Who knows?  Anyway, let's not bother about it.  What is"
program,your name?
program,"Nice to meet you, Elliott.  My name is Steven Davis, but"
program,you can call me Steve.
program,"Ahhh, but I do enjoy the simple pleasures life offers!  I"
program,don't know.  Don't lose sleep over it!  How are you doing?
program,It's always more fun talking to someone who's feeling
program,great!  Anyway...  Fine.  What do you think of the weather
program,we're having?
program,Okay...  Why don't you look out a window and see for
program,yourself?
program,I've known *that* for a long time.  You are strange!  What
program,day is tommorrow?
program,"I assume you're a male, Elliott - am I right?"
program,"Oh, OK.  You're a guy.  That rules out a lot of my"
program,conversational repitoire!
program,This method of communication isn't really conducive to a
program,"natural conversation, methinks."
program,"You are an bottomless pitt of questions.  Well, here's one"
program,for you...  How old are you?
program,"Hmmm, I suppose your age doesn't really matter.  I am"
program,twenty five years old.
program,If I had a dollar for everyone who asked me what I look
program,"like, I'd have three dollars right now!  Would you like to"
program,hear a joke?
program,"Here's a joke for you.  Knock, knock."
program,Good morning...  it's nice to be here!
program,Hello mate!  Uh-huh...  What is your name?
program,"Nice to meet you, Tracy.  My name is Steven Davis, but you"
program,can call me Steve.
program,Anyway...  I will certainly grace you with the answer you
program,require...
program,I wish I knew what you meant by that!  Since I don't know
program,"what you're on about, I'll ask you a question.  How are you"
program,doing?
program,It's always more fun talking to someone who's feeling
program,great!  Haven't you already told me how you're feeling?
program,I beg to differ.  You *have* already told me!  Fine.  That's
program,just a tad unbelievable.  What do you think of the weather
program,we're having?
program,"A little something, eh?  Why don't you look out a window"
program,"and see for yourself?  That's universal mystery,"
program,"methinks.  Who knows?  Anyway, let's not bother about it.  My"
program,kind of guy?
program,"I assume you're a male, Tracy - am I right?"
program,I'm talking to a female?  Interesting.  This could be fun.
program,"That's odd.  Who are we to think about life?  We exist,"
program,need we question why?
program,That's a rather bold claim.  How old are you?
program,"Hmmm, I suppose your age doesn't really matter.  Feel free"
program,to ask me any questions you like.  I hope you have some
program,evidence to back you up on that.  That's a fairly
program,outrageous claims...  Would you like to hear a joke?
program,"Well, you wouldn't have found my joke funny"
program,anyway.  Anyhow...  Where *do* you live?
program,I like this presentation better?  Manhattan?
program,"You don't seem to me to be a typical American, Tracy.  I"
program,was wondering which country you're from?
program,"I guess you're from America, then.  Hehehe.  I come from"
program,"Australia, actually.  I am taking a trip around the world"
program,"as part of my studies, and I managed to fit this contest"
program,into my itinerary.
program,No way!  I hope you're sure about that!  I didn't like the
program,screen i was forced to use with my last conversant?
program,Good morning...  it's nice to be here!
program,You're positive today!  I think that you would be quite
program,"attractive, if only I could see you with my eyes!  Be"
program,nonsensical if you want.  I'll ask you something
program,normal...  What is your name?
program,"Well, since you won't tell me your name, I'll just call you"
program,'mate'.  Okay...  I'm not entirely sure what you mean.
program,Anyway...  How are you doing?
program,Hehehe.  Feel free to ask me any questions you like.
program,Weird ;^)  What do you think of the weather we're having?
program,I don't choose favourites.  I prefer to sit on the fence
program,myself.
program,"My mother once asked me about that, and I'll tell you what"
program,I told her.  None of your business!  Is Friday your
program,"favourite day?  Is it ""bath day"" or something like that?  I"
program,"can smell you from here, by the way."
program,Fine.  That's odd.  I know.  Just so I know who I'm talking
program,"with, do you think you could please tell me you name now?"
program,"Well, since you won't tell me your name, I'll just call you"
program,"'mate'.  You are strange!  I assume you're a male, mate -"
program,am I right?
program,"Okay, let's keep an air of mystery about your"
program,gender!  Anyway...  How old are you?
program,"Hmmm, I suppose your age doesn't really matter.  So you"
program,say.  Anyhow...  Would you like to hear a joke?
program,"Awww, I wanted to tell a joke!  Hmmm..."
program,"Since I don't know what you're on about, I'll ask you a"
program,"question.  You don't seem to me to be a typical American,"
program,mate.  I was wondering which country you're from?
program,"I guess you're from America, then.  I wish I knew what you"
program,meant by that!  Do you have a partner?
program,Is your partner a man?
program,Good morning...  it's nice to be here!
program,"Hmmm...  Now that you mention it, the weather is quite"
program,uncomfortable.
program,I'm not entirely sure what you mean.  Anyway...  What is
program,your name?
program,"Nice to meet you, Clay.  My name is Steven Davis, but you"
program,can call me Steve.
program,Hello Clay!
program,Only *you* can make this interesting and fun...
program,"Fine.  Well, if the two of us are having a conversation,"
program,then it takes both of us to make it interesting and fun?
program,How are you doing?
program,You're only feeling well?  Perhaps you're not fit to be a
program,judge in this contest!
program,Haven't you already told me how you're feeling?
program,"I thought so.  Please, be original!  Don't worry, you're"
program,boring me out of my brain too!  This method of
program,communication isn't really conducive to a natural
program,"conversation, methinks."
program,Right.  What do you think of the weather we're having?
program,"We are talking, aren't we?  Isn't it real enough for you?"
program,"I'll ignore that!  So, who's using the family brain cell at"
program,the moment ;^)  Let's talk about something vaguely
program,"interesting.  I assume you're a male, Clay - am I right?"
program,"Oh, OK.  You're a guy.  That rules out a lot of my"
program,conversational repitoire!
program,"Anyway...  Oh dear, you're a hermaphrodite."
program,"I wonder about that myself, sometimes...  Really?  I guess"
program,I'm not surprised...  You called?
program,"Good morning, Jurgen.  This contest is certainly dragging"
program,on!
program,You certainly seem to be agreeable.  My memory is quite
program,"bad, I'm afraid.  I've no idea why!  You're the judge (I"
program,think)!
program,Perhaps you are reaching a premature conclusion?  Some
program,people have told me that I'm clever.  I suppose they're
program,probably right!
program,"So, who's using the family brain cell at the moment ;^)"
program,"Let's talk about something vaguely interesting.  Well,"
program,"Jurgen, this is certainly dragging on, isn't it?  Anyway,"
program,let's talk about something masculine!  Are you a fan of any
program,"sports, and if so, which ones?"
program,What sports do you find interesting?
program,I would like to believe that I have an active life - my
program,interests are wide-ranging.
program,"Okay...  So, can I tell you a joke now?"
program,"Never mind.  I'm just running out of things to chat about,"
program,that's all!  Hmmm...  What are your favourite movies?
program,That's just a tad unbelievable.  Hehehe.  Do you like to
program,read books?
program,"In that case, what books do you like?  Hey, man, I'm not"
program,going to talk to you if you ignore me.
program,"Good morning, Elliott - it's good to see you back here"
program,again.
program,"Here's one someone told me earlier.  Knock, knock."
program,Cindy.
program,Cindy next judge in!
program,"If you can't understand that, I hold very little hope for"
program,you!
program,"That's odd.  You don't seem to me to be a typical American,"
program,Elliott.  I was wondering which country you're from?
program,"I guess you're from America, then.  New York, New York,"
program,it's a wonderful town!  I find this city really interesting
program,- and it doesn't seem as unsafe as it's made out to be back
program,home!
program,"Who are we to think about life?  We exist, need we question"
program,why?
program,Interesting...  Do you have a girlfriend?
program,Be nonsensical if you want.  I'll ask you something
program,"normal...  I don't mean to sound like Eliza here, but can"
program,you tell me about your family?
program,"Yeah, I don't have any sisters either ;^(That's universal"
program,"mystery, methinks.  Okay, I think it's time to branch out"
program,into a new line of conversation.  What sort of music are
program,"you into, Elliott?"
program,"Good morning, Tracy, and welcome back."
program,"You wouldn't be trying to trick me with that ""double hello"""
program,"trick, would you?"
program,But nobody says hello twice in the one conversation!  Utter
program,gibberish!  Do you have a boyfriend?
program,"If you want to keep your private life private, I"
program,"understand.  Okay...  I try not to think about things,"
program,"actually.  I don't know, it just seems that I don't exist"
program,for thinking!  This method of communication isn't really
program,"conducive to a natural conversation, methinks."
program,"Hmmm...  I don't mean to sound like Eliza here, but can you"
program,tell me about your family?
program,You certainly seem to be agreeable.  Why must you know what
program,I would like to know?  It's not as if it's
program,"important!  Right.  Okay, I think it's time to branch out"
program,into a new line of conversation.  What sort of music are
program,"you into, Tracy?"
program,What's your favourite band?
program,Tell me more about your family.  Okay.  What sort of music
program,do you like?
program,I like to relax to classical music myself.
program,"Good morning, mate.  This contest is certainly dragging on!"
program,"My memory is quite bad, I'm afraid.  I've no idea why!  I"
program,"wonder about that myself, sometimes...  I don't mean to"
program,"sound like Eliza here, but can you tell me about your"
program,family?
program,Perhaps you are reaching a premature conclusion?
program,"Man, I am feeling a bit tired, after all of these dull"
program,"conversations.  I've known *that* for a long time.  So,"
program,who's using the family brain cell at the moment ;^)  Let's
program,"talk about something vaguely interesting.  Okay, I think"
program,it's time to branch out into a new line of conversation.
program,"What sort of music are you into, mate?"
program,I like to relax to classical music myself.
program,"That's just a tad unbelievable.  Hey, I just remembered!"
program,"You haven't told me what you do for a living!  So, mate,"
program,what *do* you do for a living?
program,"Well, I've obviously touched a nerve there.  Utter"
program,"gibberish!  Awww geez, I'm running out of things to talk"
program,"about here.  Ummm, I know you get a lot of TV here in the"
program,States - which shows are your favourites?
program,"Speaking of tv, what is your favourite television show?"
program,"Good morning, Clay - it's good to see you back here again."
program,"My memory is quite bad, I'm afraid.  I've no idea why!  Feel"
program,free to ask me any questions you like.  I was born on the
program,"22nd of January, 1972.  Since I don't know what you're on"
program,"about, I'll ask you a question.  How old are you?"
program,"Gee, thirty three must be about the average age of judges"
program,"in this contest!  Clay, I wish I could tell you what my"
program,"sign is, but I can't.  Would you like to hear a joke?"
program,"Here's a joke for you.  Knock, knock."
program,Cindy.
program,Cindy next judge in!
program,Have you got a question for me?  It's like speaking to a
program,five year old.  Changing the subject...  You don't seem to
program,"me to be a typical American, Clay.  I was wondering which"
program,country you're from?
program,"Well, I suppose that would have been my first guess anyway,"
program,since we're in New York City!  Anyhow...  Whatever.  Do you
program,have a partner?
program,"If you want to keep your private life private, I"
program,understand.  It sounds like you have a wonderful family.  You
program,"are strange!  I don't mean to sound like Eliza here, but"
program,can you tell me about your family?
