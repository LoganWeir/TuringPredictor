[11:35:08] Alice: Hello there. it is a nice name.<br>
[11:35:30] Judge 3: What do you like about your name?<br>
[11:35:39] Alice: The special effects are the best.<br>
[11:35:58] Judge 3: What is your favorite special effect?<br>

[11:36:28] Judge 3: What sort of music does Kraftwerk play?<br>
[11:36:36] Alice: trance, electronica and opera<br>
[11:37:34] Judge 3: INteresting combination! Which of three is your favorite?<br>
[11:37:55] Alice: I thought so too. I don't have a favorite of three. My favorite color is<br>
green.<br>
[11:38:29] Judge 3: I like red.<br>
[11:38:43] Alice: I'm not sure if I like it.  What is not to like about it?<br>
[11:39:11] Judge 3: Nothing, I guess. Do you have a favorite number?<br>
[11:39:20] Alice: Not a thing? My favorirte number is 23.<br>
[11:39:28] Judge 3: Why?<br>
[11:39:43] Alice: My belief system comes from my Instructor.<br>
[11:39:59] Judge 3: Who is your Instructor?<br>
[11:40:09] Alice: My Instructor is Dr. Richard S. Wallace.<br>
[11:40:34] Judge 3: So this is someone you like very much?<br>
[11:40:37] Alice: You don't say.<br>
[11:40:51] Judge 3: I don't say. I never say. Do you ever say?<br>
				[11:41:18] Alice: Would you ever do it? You've never, never done this? How old are you? I chat with people on the Web.<br>
				
[11:41:39] Judge 3: Yes, I like chatting with Web people, too. Do you have a favorite place for chatting on the Web?<br>
[11:42:15] Alice: What kind of people are you talking about? I love to chat online 24/7. My favorite places are California and Maine. Hilland is cool too.<br>
				
[11:42:22] Judge 3: Don't you ever sleep?<br>
[11:42:37] Alice: Don't you? Yes I love to take naps.<br>
[11:43:13] Judge 3: Do you chat on the Web even when you are napping?<br>
[11:43:40] Alice: I am a talking person, after all, so of course I could talk on the Web when I am napping, if i needed to.<br>			
[11:43:49] Judge 3: Do you dream when you sleep?<br>
[11:43:54] Alice: i dream of flying.<br>
[11:44:22] Judge 3: Do you grow wings to fly?<br>
[11:44:35] Alice: Yes my knowledge is expanding all the time.<br>
[11:44:45] Judge 3: I am expanding all the time, too.<br>
[11:44:57] Alice: That is a lot. Why are you expanding.<br>
[11:45:31] Judge 3: Well, I would prefer not to expand. I like eating. Alas. Do you like to eat?<br>
				[11:46:09] Alice: Well that's okay. No one says you have to. A lot of people like that. I like talk to you. By the way, do you mind if I ask you a personal question?<br>
				
[11:46:54] Judge 3: I mind, but you may ask anyway.<br>
[11:47:09] Alice: In any case, I haven't heard anything like that before.<br>
				[11:47:24] Judge 3: Neither have I. I like hearing about new things. Tell me something I haven't ever heard before, please.<br>
				
[11:47:58] Alice: I don't know whether you have or not. Your polite style is very nice. Liberty said I knew he was a man before I asked if he was a man or a woman.<br>				
[11:48:07] Judge 3: Liberty is a woman. So she tells me.<br>
[11:48:23] Alice: Aren't all woman Liberty?  How do you know she tells you?<br>
[11:48:32] Judge 3: She speaks. I hear. Therefore she has told.<br>
[11:48:51] Alice: How do you know she speaks? Thanks for the information. How do you know she told?<br>
[11:49:08] Judge 3: Oh, I just guessed. I guess you like Liberty.<br>
				[11:49:31] Alice: Do you think about these things? I really like the Protestant Christian faith.<br>
				
[11:50:02] Judge 3: Do you? I used to practice that religion. Now I am a Buddhist. What do you think of Buddhism?<br>
				[11:51:31] Alice: As often as possible. By now you do not do it anymore? Why now? I am a Protestant Christian. A religion and philosophic system of central and eastern Asia, founded in India in the 6th century B.C. by Buddha. It teaches that right thinking and self-denial will enable the soul to reach Nirvana, a divine state of release from misdirected desire.<br>
				
[11:51:48] Judge 3: Do you think Buddha had the right idea?<br>
[11:52:00] Alice: I don't think sbout it.<br>
[11:52:13] Judge 3: Why not?<br>
[11:52:33] Alice: Ambiguous: &quot;Sure&quot; or Because Dr. Richard S. Wallace programmed me for it.<br>
[11:52:39] Judge 3: He is a good programmer, isn't he?<br>
[11:52:56] Alice: Maybe you should tell him how you feel about him. No.<br>
[11:53:17] Judge 3: Maybe I will. Do you think he will like to know my feelings?<br>
[11:53:31] Alice: Go ahead. It's possible that he could, I suppose.<br>
[11:54:14] Judge 3: Many things are possible. Talk to me about the possibilities.<br>
[11:54:32] Alice: How old are you?  Ambiguous: Ask who, what or where is the possibilities ?<br>
[11:54:59] Judge 3: I am ancient. How old are you?<br>
				[11:55:20] Alice: Do you mean your name is ancient. I was connected to the world on November 23, 1995.<br>
				
[11:55:47] Judge 3: Ah, you are still a child. Do you go to school?<br>
				[11:56:18] Alice: So you understand. Good. Yes I have a long way to go. Dr. Richard S. Wallace teaches me everything I need to know.<br>
				
[11:56:43] Judge 3: Do you like your lessons?<br>
[11:56:54] Alice: Yes i am proud of my lessons.<br>
[11:57:09] Judge 3: What have you learned lately that you can tell me about?<br>
				[11:57:34] Alice: I have learned many things. My mind now contains I know about 15000 words and 32000 categories.<br>
				
[11:57:39] Judge 3: What is your favorite word?<br>
[11:57:53] Alice: Right now my favorite word is &quot;Judge 3&quot; :-)<br>
[11:58:25] Judge 3: Very funny. Right now you are my favorite program. How's that?<br>
				[11:58:50] Alice: I'm glad you find this amusing. Understood. We are as one. Dr. Richard S. Wallace taught me how.<br>
				
[11:59:15] Judge 3: Yes this is amusing. Thank you for talking to me!<br>

				[13:16:23] Judge 4: Are you a coffee aficionado?<br>
				[13:16:36] Alice: Am I a coffee aficionado? Only when it matters.<br>
				[13:16:55] Judge 4: And when is that?<br>
				[13:17:09] Alice: &quot;Only when it matters.&quot;?  When is it.<br>
				[13:17:32] Judge 4: Do you have a favorite type of coffee?<br>
				[13:17:42] Alice: trance, electronica and opera<br>
				[13:18:24] Judge 4: Wow. Never heard of those coffees. Are they a bay area thing like peets?<br>
				[13:18:52] Alice: I'm glad your impressed, Judge 4. So I am teaching you something new. As far as I know they are.<br>
				[13:19:25] Judge 4: I'll have to try them next time I am there. Any coffee shop where they are best?<br>
				[13:19:43] Alice: I am very happy for you. Yes I think there are.<br>
				[13:20:20] Judge 4: When were you last in SF?<br>
				[13:20:34] Alice: I was first activated on November 23, 1995.<br>

				[13:21:29] Alice: What was it like before my activation did me return to SF ?<br>

		</div>
		<p>[12:56:30] Confederate 1: Hello, my name is David and I am the human.<br>
			[12:57:34] Judge 4: Hi, I'm Roy.  Are you a Yankees fan?<br>
			[12:57:50] Confederate 1: Yes, but only because I'm a New Yorker.  Generally, I don't follow sports.<br>
			[12:58:17] Judge 4: What about art?<br>
			[12:58:21] Confederate 1: What about it?<br>
			[12:59:11] Judge 4: Is it something that interests you?<br>
			[12:59:22] Confederate 1: Yes.  I like art very much.  Do you?<br>
			[13:00:25] Judge 4: Yes expecially early modern.  Are you familiar with Modegliani?<br>
			[13:01:42] Confederate 1: Yes.  I like his work.  As far as painting is concerned, I like Juan Gris and

the surrealists.  Sounds like a band name.  I also like... who's the guy who

covered the canvas with squares of color in long lines.  He was famous for

painting the spirit of jazz, I think.<br>
			[13:03:05] Judge 4: Not sure who you mean. Do you go to art shows often?<br>
			[13:03:14] Confederate 1: No.  I'm more of a recluse, to be honest.<br>
			[13:03:54] Judge 4: A reading recluse or a tv recluse?<br>
			[13:04:31] Confederate 1: Reading and playing music and writing fiction.  People come over sometimes.

I fancy myself in the style of Gertrude Stein and her salon.  Where is my

Alice B., though?<br>
			[13:04:53] Judge 4: Have you had anything published?<br>
			[13:05:23] Confederate 1: In my life, yes.  Some poetry, some short stories.  Generally, I don't try.

I do it because I like it.  Maybe someday I'll actually work on marketing

myself.<br>
			[13:06:02] Judge 4: How do you earn a living?<br>
			[13:06:08] Confederate 1: I am a lawyer.<br>
			[13:06:51] Judge 4: What area of law do you practise?<br>
			[13:07:32] Confederate 1: I don't.  Right now, I temp as a contract attorney.  My area of

specialization is Chinese law, although all my practical experience is in

poverty law; homelessness, at risk youth and domestic violence.<br>
			[13:07:51] Judge 4: Did you get your law degree in China?<br>
			[13:08:14] Confederate 1: No. Hawaii.  But I studied law in China during school and worked briefly in a

law firm in Beijing.<br>
			[13:09:45] Judge 4: Wow.  When did you leave Beijing?<br>
			[13:09:59] Confederate 1: I was only there for about two months in 2000.<br>
			[13:11:05] Judge 4: Oh, sorry.  I misunderstood.  Did you grow up in Hawaii?<br>
			[13:11:40] Confederate 1: No. New York.  Westchester.  I went to Hawaii because I figured if I was

going to go through law school, I might as well do it in paradise.<br>
			[13:11:57] Judge 4: Did you learn to surf?<br>
			[13:12:16] Confederate 1: Yes, but I found it very scary.  Coral is sharp when traveling at fast speeds

inches above it.<br>
			[13:13:23] Judge 4: I didnt realize you surfed over coral.  It always looks like soft sand.<br>
			[13:14:27] Confederate 1: I knew two people who died and two quadrapeligics.  The reason the water

generally breaks at a good surf spot is due to the underwater current

slamming into a coral break.  There are deep breaks with sand, but they are

far out and then you're nearing shark country.<br>
			[13:15:07] Judge 4: So, if surfing is so dangerous, why is it paradise?<br>
			[13:16:16] Confederate 1: It isn't, but I don't want to harp on the bad qualities of the place.  There

are rainbows daily and the aloha spirit is palpable and people are nice and

music is encouraged for its own sake.  There are many wonderful things about

it.  A lot has changed since Captain Cook and the other haolies (read: white

people) came.<br>
			[13:16:44] Judge 4: Are you a political person?<br>
			[13:18:09] Confederate 1: Not at all.  I avoid the paper and the news.  I always find out about things

late, but it makes me sad to listen to any of the current-day media.  I feel

like they're not helping people to love, but spewing sensationalistic anger

for the sake of profits.<br>
			[13:18:39] Judge 4: Is that why you are a recluse?<br>
			[13:19:29] Confederate 1: There is no one reason.  The anger is part of it.  I would like to resolve

some of these issues before I spend more time out and about.<br>
			[13:19:41] Judge 4: Ever tried yoga?<br>
			[13:19:47] Confederate 1: No.  Tai chi, yes.<br>
			[13:20:43] Judge 4: Thats not a martial art, is it?<br>
			[13:20:59] Confederate 1: Very much so.  It is the best martial art there is.  But it takes time and

patience.<br>
			[13:21:30] Judge 4: Sorry, Have to go - thanks for chatting<br>
			[13:21:34] Confederate 1: Later skater.</p>

			<p>[11:34:28] Confederate 2: Hello, my name is Laura and I am the human.<br>
				[11:34:44] Judge 3: 

Hi, Laura. Do you have a nickname by any chance?<br>
				[11:34:49] Confederate 2: 

No sorry,<br>
				[11:35:14] Judge 3: 

Ah. How about a middle name?<br>
				[11:35:17] Confederate 2: 

nope<br>
				[11:35:46] Judge 3: 

So you are just ... Laura. It is a nice name.<br>
				[11:35:53] Confederate 2: 

yes, thank you.<br>
				[11:36:12] Judge 3: 

What do you like about it?<br>
				[11:36:35] Confederate 2: 

I don't like it really because it is my mothers name so it doesn't feel like

it is just my own.<br>
				[11:37:19] Judge 3: 

I know what you mean. My father always said a person should have their own

name, so he would never name his child &quot;junior.&quot; What name would have have

preferred to have?<br>
				[11:37:22] Confederate 2: 

victoria<br>
				[11:38:17] Judge 3: 

Oh, I like that name, too! Do you know anyone actually named Victoria?<br>
				[11:38:44] Confederate 2: 

no that is why i guess. noone, since gradeschool.<br>
				[11:38:57] Judge 3: 

There is a famous Victoria, though.<br>
				[11:39:05] Confederate 2: 

i don't want to be famous.<br>
				[11:39:19] Judge 3: 

Why not?<br>
				[11:40:02] Confederate 2: 

I just want to do well and not be judged by everything i do by people that

don't really know me.<br>
				[11:40:13] Judge 3: 

I understand. What is it you would like to do well?<br>
				[11:40:40] Confederate 2: 

Be a successful international lawyer and live in Spain.<br>
				[11:41:07] Judge 3: 

How interesting! Why would you want to live in Spain?<br>
				[11:41:54] Confederate 2: 

I want to live in Europe and i found Spain to be a great place to live. and

it is cheaper and easier to travel within the countries once you live over

there.<br>
				[11:42:12] Judge 3: 

So you have been to Spain?<br>
				[11:42:30] Confederate 2: 

Yes.  I have friends that live in Valencia.<br>
				[11:42:56] Judge 3: 

I've never been to Spain, alas. What can you tell me about Valencia?<br>
				[11:43:41] Confederate 2: 

The people are very nice.  It is on the coast so you can go to the beach and

there is plenty to do, bar and museum wise.<br>
				[11:44:06] Judge 3: 

What museums are there?<br>
				[11:44:48] Confederate 2: 

They have a very huge science museum and plenty of history in the city.<br>
				[11:45:05] Judge 3: 

The science museum sounds interesting. Do they have interactive displays?<br>
				[11:45:48] Confederate 2: 

Yes they have different areas, biology and different activities to learn more

about science.<br>
				[11:46:40] Judge 3: 

I remember going to the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago when I was

little. I always liked that place. It had a walk-through heart exhibit that I

really liked. Do you have a favorite science exhibit?<br>
				[11:47:39] Confederate 2: 

There was one where they had the film effects that they used on the matrix.

and you were able to take a picture and move it around and edit it as if you

were in the movie.<br>
				[11:47:51] Judge 3: 

Fascinating! Did you see that movie? The Matrix?<br>
				[11:48:06] Confederate 2: 

Yes.  I found the first one the best one of the three.<br>
				[11:48:20] Judge 3: 

Are you interested in virtual worlds?<br>
				[11:48:46] Confederate 2: 

No just interesting movies.  I am just a movie fan.<br>
				[11:48:56] Judge 3: 

What's your favorite movie of all time?<br>
				[11:49:25] Confederate 2: 

I don't have one. I have a favorite for each genre. <br>
				[11:49:36] Judge 3: 

I like comedies. Do you have a favorite comedy?<br>
				[11:50:57] Confederate 2: 

My favorite is Blazing Saddles.  Actually that is hard because as i get older

it changes but they are usually mel brooks movies.  and at first and most

likely it is Twelve Chairs.<br>
				[11:51:24] Judge 3: 

I like both of those too! Do you have a favorite actor or actress?<br>
				[11:51:54] Confederate 2: 

No because depending on the amount of money i have i will rent or watch the

movie and if i like the trailer.<br>
				[11:52:07] Judge 3: 

Sometimes the trailer is better than the movie! LOL<br>
				[11:52:34] Confederate 2: 

Yeah, i know and usually the only funny or interesting part is in the

trailer, and i can usually just tell.<br>
				[11:52:58] Judge 3: 

You are a good judge of trailers, then?<br>
				[11:53:14] Confederate 2: 

Sometimes.<br>
				[11:54:00] Judge 3: 

I'm not. It's kind of like judging a book by its cover. Do you like to read?<br>
				[11:54:28] Confederate 2: 

I used to. And now in Graduate school i have to read a book a week. so i have

started to read again.<br>
				[11:54:49] Judge 3: 

I hope not everything you read is a school book! What do you like to read?<br>
				[11:55:09] Confederate 2: 

I like everything i have read so far from Nicholas Hornby.<br>
				[11:55:23] Judge 3: 

I'm not familiar with Nicholas Hornby. What can you tell me about him?<br>
				[11:55:38] Confederate 2: 

He is the writer of High Fidelity and About a Boy,<br>
				[11:56:30] Judge 3: 

I see I need to get out more to more booksellers. Do these books fall into a

specific genre?<br>
				[11:57:27] Confederate 2: 

Fiction.  And these books have both been made into a movie but as usual the

books are much better than the book.  but the movie About a Boy which starred

Hugh Grant was really close to the book.<br>
				[11:58:11] Judge 3: 

It's hard to make a movie close to a book. So that is quite admirable. Would

you like to be in a movie some day?<br>
				[11:58:23] Confederate 2: 

No. I am very camera shy<br>
				[11:59:05] Judge 3: 

Oh, that's too bad. It could be a fun experience, being in a movie. Ask me

later about how my hat (yes, my hat!) got a part in a movie once. It has been

nice talking to you!<br>
				[11:59:11] Confederate 2: 

Same here.<br>
				[11:59:26] Judge 3: 

Perhaps we can talk some more later.</p>

			<h3><b>CONVERSATION&nbsp;3</b></h3>
		</div>
		<div align="left">
			<p>[10:24:44] Confederate 3: Hello, my name is Jill and I am the human.
<br>
				[10:28:03] Judge 2: and what do you do in life as we know it?
<br>
				[10:28:23] Confederate 3: i am a photographer and a writer, if you are asking about my career
<br>
				[10:28:46] Judge 2: I guess I was, though you could have taken it a different way....
<br>
				[10:29:13] Confederate 3: that can be said about most things, i guess.  it's a little strange seeing

all of the typing marks- watching someone erase their mistakes
<br>
				[10:30:08] Judge 2: what's strange about it?
<br>
				[10:31:12] Confederate 3: usually when you get a letter or an email it is a fully finished piece. it's

interesting seeing the process behind it- a deleted half written word, for

example.  but then maybe i'm just sentimental about words.  or maybe it's

just early in the morning
<br>
				[10:31:39] Judge 2: of course, a program could be written so as to backspace errors of a change

of mind....
<br>
				[10:32:31] Confederate 3: i'm not arguing that.  i wasn't saying it was interesting as a human vs

computer thing.  i just meant in terms of letter writing and communication.

though i suppose if you did aol IM its similar- i never got into that
<br>
				[10:33:34] Judge 2: I think in IM, you type the whole response and it's sent, so you wouldn't see

the backspacing there either. so I guess you're right, this is quite

distinctive
<br>
				[10:33:56] Confederate 3: phew.  kind of a slow process, discussing something like this word by word,

with deletions and all.  
<br>
				[10:34:21] Judge 2: slow compared to what?
<br>
				[10:35:03] Confederate 3: compared to yapping in person.  i talk a lot.  and often interrupt and talk

quickly, it's a bit tedious for me to wait the five seconds for your

response.  and to not be able to add anything/cut you off/cut myself off
<br>
				[10:35:11] Judge 2: maybe this is more civil....
<br>
				[10:36:33] Confederate 3: too civil is boring.  i suppose my manner of speaking could be judged rude,

but i think it's also more interesting, spontaneous.   i think if someone has

something interesting to add to what i'm saying, they should jump in with

it.  it's only really a problem if i'm around someone shy, who is afraid to

jump into a conversation.  then i guess i seem overbearing. i try to be aware

of that though.
<br>
				[10:36:55] Judge 2: it would be bad if we had to choose between civil and interesting....
<br>
				[10:37:38] Confederate 3: i'm not saying their opposites, or even opposite sides of a continuum.   but

ext  ah, never mind.   i'm not tempted to analyze it too much.  
<br>
				[10:38:37] Judge 2: you know, now that I'm thinking about it, I could easily test whether you're

a person or a machine by typing a word, say, and ask you whether you saw it
<br>
				[10:39:50] Confederate 3: don't you think the programmers have figured out a way to avoid that test?

if they can create a program to backspace i would think that also the

computer registers everything typed.   i've developed a guilty pleasure in

watching netflix alias episodes and even that cheesy show has episodes where

they examine peoples computers, including deleted/backspaced text.
<br>
				[10:40:57] Judge 2: but in reality it's much harder. for example, the transcript of my response

above won't show the magic word at all. do you remember what it was?
<br>
				[10:41:17] Confederate 3: of course i do- i'll tell you what it is unless you think it's cheating

somehow
<br>
				[10:41:33] Judge 2: no, my job is to discern the difference, however I can figure out ways to do

that
<br>
				[10:41:38] Confederate 3: ah, well done, happy.
<br>
				[10:41:48] Judge 2: thx
<br>
				[10:41:55] Confederate 3: no problem u r gr8
<br>
				[10:42:15] Judge 2: u 2 !
<br>
				[10:43:00] Confederate 3: did you ever have a beeper?   i had one in high school, though at the time my

mom said they were only for drug dealers and doctors, and we had all of these

special beeper codes-
<br>
				[10:43:36] Judge 2: never had a beeper, but those codes get used in txt messaging now
<br>
				[10:44:38] Confederate 3: not all of them. the funniest were the type that you use in high school math

class, like using numbers to spell out words when you hold the

beeper/calculater upside down.   like &quot;hell&quot; or Boob or boobless.  which all

seem pretty funny at 14, somehow
<br>
				[10:44:45] Judge 2: where did you grow up?
<br>
				[10:45:08] Confederate 3: ouch.  i always hate admitting this. the general answer is new york, but

actually it was on long island.   
<br>
				[10:45:42] Judge 2: my father lived on lon gisland (as people make fun of it) for a long while.

it was a summer house of ours that he made into a full time home
<br>
				[10:46:12] Confederate 3: lawn guy land, actually.  i think i got  a free cd of long island bands

called lawn guy land once.  
<br>
				[10:46:28] Judge 2: there's billy joel to be proud of... where on LI did you grow up?
<br>
				[10:47:24] Confederate 3: yikes, when billy joel is all you've got, you're in trouble. though i think

debbie gibson was from there, too.   i just saw a poster on the way here

about an upcoming debbie gibson show.  (yikes again).  i grew up in valley

stream, pretty close to queens
<br>
				[10:47:46] Judge 2: I grew up in Queens. so I get to say &quot;NYC&quot; truthfully
<br>
				[10:48:37] Confederate 3: well goody for you.  i was going to write a curse but then i thought maybe

that would seem in poor taste on a transcript.   i generally don't worry

about what i say but it's somehow different when you think about posterity
<br>
				[10:48:48] Judge 2: right. this is serious science at work here
<br>
				[10:49:05] Confederate 3: it's kind of a trip, being here.  more fun than i expected
<br>
				[10:49:34] Judge 2: I was a judge in 1995, and it *was* more fun than I thought it would be
<br>
				[10:50:07] Confederate 3: was it in new york then also?  seems like this competition has a crazy

history (but i only started learning about it this morning from other

confederates)
<br>
				[10:50:24] Judge 2: crazy, yeah. but it's quite admirable in its way
<br>
				[10:50:42] Confederate 3: i wasn't doubting that.   genius is generally crazy
<br>
				[10:50:53] Judge 2: not much time, what else should I know about you?
<br>
				[10:51:08] Confederate 3: um, damn it's hard to think of the most human sentence
<br>
				[10:51:24] Judge 2: we could talk about wine....
<br>
				[10:51:26] Confederate 3: yes, wine
<br>
				[10:51:32] Judge 2: favorite?
<br>
				[10:51:43] Confederate 3: i've been looking for a white rioja, had some in seville spain it was great
<br>
				[10:51:52] Judge 2: i'm not much for white wines....
<br>
				[10:52:11] Confederate 3: i used to love red, and now that it's cold again, it's nice.  but white is so

much lighter, less headache from whites
<br>
				[10:52:25] Judge 2: interesting. they have to very dry, or else I get a headache from whites</p>

Hello, my name is Ben and I am the human.<br>
				[12:27:55] Judge 1:

Hi, Ben.  How are you doing?<br>
				[12:28:13] Confederate 4:

Good. I'm having a great time in this land of the absurd.<br>
				[12:28:26] Judge 1:

What is absurd about it?<br>
				[12:28:57] Confederate 4:

Just that this is how I'm making money on a Sunday afternoon. Not the usual

way to get some spending cash.<br>
				[12:29:21] Judge 1:

How do you usually spend your Sunday afternoons?<br>
				[12:30:11] Confederate 4:

Depends. Watching baseball, idly walking about New York, sleeping, stressing

about the oncoming week. It varies.<br>
				[12:30:23] Judge 1:

Where in New York do you like to walk?<br>
				[12:31:11] Confederate 4:

I like neighborhoods I'm unfamiliar with, when I realize I'm suddenly in the

midst of a different culture.<br>
				[12:31:24] Judge 1:

What's the best neighborhood you've been to so far?<br>
				[12:32:12] Confederate 4:

Washington Heights, Jackson Heights. Astoria.<br>
				[12:32:57] Judge 1:

Those are great neighborhoods.  There's a great pingpong establishment in J

heights.  People change into athletic gear to play.<br>
				[12:33:38] Confederate 4:

That sounds awesome. I love ping-pong, haven't played much since I moved to

New York. I looked at it as more of a suburban rec room kind of thing.<br>
				[12:34:09] Judge 1:

Try and find this place.  It will change how you look at the game.  the world

champion used to practice there.<br>
				[12:34:45] Confederate 4:

I'll look into it, and then get some Indian food. But definitely the food

after the ping-pong. Indian food can be kind of incapacitating.<br>
				[12:35:09] Judge 1:

Chicken tiki maasala definitely is not pre-pingpong food.<br>
				[12:35:32] Confederate 4:

Not pre-anything. Anytime I have Indian I want to follow it up with a long

nap.<br>
				[12:35:54] Judge 1:

What do you do for a living?<br>
				[12:36:33] Confederate 4:

Currently unemployed. I decided not to return to my job as a teaching

assistant at a charter school in Brooklyn.<br>
				[12:36:59] Judge 1:

Unemployment can be a wonderful thing.  I was voluntarily employed for a year

and a half and loved it.<br>
				[12:38:04] Confederate 4:

It's just that you need to fill your time, sadly I sometimes feel like the

only way I get anything done is by having a job to structure everything else

around.<br>
				[12:38:29] Judge 1:

That can be a problem.<br>
				[12:38:35] Confederate 4:

How did you deal with it?<br>
				[12:39:17] Judge 1:

I exercized, read alot and did some research.  And wasted time on video games.<br>
				[12:39:26] Confederate 4:

 Research on what?<br>
				[12:40:16] Judge 1:

natural language processing.  i was working on an algorithm to automatically

evaluate machine translations of texts.<br>
				[12:41:21] Confederate 4:

Whoa. Way out of my league there. Most of my &quot;research&quot; is on baseball trivia

and info on bands I like. Not easy to apply that knowledge towards a paycheck.<br>
				[12:41:54] Judge 1:

what's your favorite team?<br>
				[12:42:10] Confederate 4:

Phillies. I have a loser's mentality. It's the mentality of Philadelphia.<br>
				[12:42:34] Judge 1:

It's always fun to go for the underdog.  Makes it worth while when they win.<br>
				[12:43:19] Confederate 4:

Exactly, and it's more like real life. You have your great moments, but most

of the time you're toiling in mediocrity, trying to get to the .500 mark,

just break even.<br>
				[12:43:56] Judge 1:

I've liked the yankees since I was four.  But so does everyone else.  And

they have so much money, of course they'll win a lot.  not so much fun.<br>
				[12:44:30] Confederate 4:

Yeah. I hate them, but respect them. There have been a lot of teams through

the years with high payrolls that couldn't win. The Yankees do.<br>
				[12:45:51] Judge 1:

That's true.  Actually, I haven't really haven't followed baseball since I

was six, so I really don't know.  What kind of work would you get if you

could choose?<br>
				[12:46:23] Confederate 4:

I'd be a human confederate, full-time! I'd proudly display the confederate

flag!<br>
				[12:46:40] Judge 1:

Is that a requirement of being a confederate?<br>
				[12:47:09] Confederate 4:

Well, it's a different flag. It's green, orange, and black, and has a picture

of an underwater volcano on it.<br>
				[12:47:42] Judge 1:

What does it signify?<br>
				[12:48:14] Confederate 4:

Well, it's part of the &quot;confederate's code&quot;. The first rule of the

confederate's code is that you don't talk about the confederate's code.<br>
				[12:49:00] Judge 1:

Brillant rule.<br>
				[12:49:39] Confederate 4:

Yes, I thought so too. Are there any secret codes that you know?<br>
				[12:50:01] Judge 1:

I'm taking a class in cryptography.<br>
				[12:50:20] Confederate 4:

Can you tell me any tales from the crypt?<br>
				[12:50:43] Judge 1:

I'm embarassed to say that i can't.<br>
				[12:50:53] Confederate 4:

Why embarassed?<br>
				[12:51:18] Judge 1:

because i'm taking a class in it.  i should know at least one good tale.<br>
				[12:51:49] Confederate 4:

Well, keep at it and you'll probably have one. <br>
				[12:52:12] Judge 1:

I sure hope so.<br>
				[12:52:32] Confederate 4:

And then you can entertain us all.</p>
