				9:15:5: JUDGE : That's what I meant. It's never called &quot;Michigan State&quot;?<br>
				9:15:39: CONFEDERATE: I don't know. I never went to a game or attended that university.<br>
				9:15:56: JUDGE : so you were a &quot;townie&quot;?<br>
				9:16:35: CONFEDERATE: No. I was attending lawschool at Thomas M. Cooley. Which is in Lansing.<br>

			<p>10:3:38: CONFEDERATE: Hello, my name is Ben and I am the human.<br>
					10:5:17: JUDGE : Hi, I'm Roy. Are you a Yankees fan?<br>
					10:6:41: CONFEDERATE: No, not at all. They represent a lot of things I cannot stand<br>
					10:7:45: JUDGE : What about Barry Bonds. Did you see his 700th?<br>
					10:8:28: CONFEDERATE: Just on the News. And he hit #701 last night. I respect him as an individual.<br>
					10:9:41: JUDGE : I didn't know that. Do you think he will get Ruth this year?<br>
					10:10:13: CONFEDERATE: No way. April 2005. April 21st, 2005, if I had to be precise.<br>
					10:11:19: JUDGE : What about where in the stadium?<br>
					10:11:56: CONFEDERATE: Some jerk in a kayak will get the ball. It will land in McCovey Cove.<br>
					10:12:27: JUDGE : Probably the same guy who got all the other Bonds hits.<br>
					10:13:27: CONFEDERATE: Not a bad way to make a living. But if I had to catch one home run ball I would want it to be from Julio Franco, because he is the oldest man in the world.<br>
					10:14:16: JUDGE : Julio Franco? I never heard of him. Who does he play for?<br>
					10:15:25: CONFEDERATE: The Braves. He's been around forever, the oldest man in baseball. The oldest pitcher in the game is the Mets' John Franco. So the oldest pitcher and the oldest position player in all of baseball are both named J. Franco. It's uncanny and I am endlessly fascinated by that coincidence.<br>
					10:16:42: JUDGE : Do you follow any other sports?<br>
					10:17:27: CONFEDERATE: No. But maybe they follow me! If so I'm filing a restraining order! I especially wouldn't want to be followed by the NHL. They smell bad.<br>
					10:18:29: JUDGE : A restraining order won't work on those guys - it will only get them mmore determined!<br>
					10:19:10: CONFEDERATE: Excellent point. I should probably just hire some toothless goon to protect me then. Know of any?<br>
					10:20:33: JUDGE : Strangly - not. But maybe some out of work hockey player would be interested. Most of them are dentally challanged.<br>
					10:21:14: CONFEDERATE: Dentally challenged and mentally challenged. It's a lethal combination, like salt and slugs.<br>
					10:22:0: JUDGE : Speaking of which - do you have a favorite food?<br>
					10:23:24: CONFEDERATE: I won't eat slugs! I dreamed once I was at a restaurant and I ordered snails, but the waiter brought out slugs instead. They made me ill. In waking life I'm a big fan of lots of food. Vegetarian Indian cuisine is a recent favorite.<br>
					10:23:50: JUDGE : Are you a vegaterian?<br>
					10:24:40: CONFEDERATE: No, but I've been growing more and more uncomfortable about eating meat. I'd like to know where it's coming from.<br>
					10:26:3: JUDGE : I agree. Did you see that movie - the one where the guy just ate McDonalds for a month?<br>
					10:27:7: CONFEDERATE: Super Size Me. I didn't see it, actually. Before the movie came out I had already decided I was never eating there again anyway. Although I was just in Maine, and McDonalds there had McLobster Rolls!<br>
					10:28:58: JUDGE : Yeah - thats the one. Pretty frightening. Any way got to go. Thanks for chatting<br>
					10:29:47: CONFEDERATE: No proble. Catch you later<br>

			<p>11:5:33: CONFEDERATE: Hello, my name is Jill and I am the human.<br>
				11:6:52: JUDGE : Hey, Jill.  How are you doing<br>
				11:7:19: CONFEDERATE: I'm ok.  could use some more coffee, but i'm having a lot of fun.<br>
				11:7:43: JUDGE : That's good.  Did you get caught in the rain on the way over here<br>
				11:8:54: CONFEDERATE: no, it wasn't raining when i came over.   yesterday i tried to come by in the mornign for an orientation but couldn't get here because the subways were floodedoops sorry i keep hitting return instead of clicking and then wondering why my message isn't sending...<br>
				11:9:35: JUDGE : Yeah, I'm doing the same thing.  Where do you live<br>
				11:10:7: CONFEDERATE: lower hell's kitchen- midtown west.   9th ave and 35th street, right near port authorityyou?<br>
				11:10:32: JUDGE : 9th and 58th.  I guess that makes us vertical neightbors.<br>
				11:11:39: CONFEDERATE: yeah, it's funny.   when i lived in brooklyn or downtown, someone 15 bblocks away wasn't considered a neighbor.  but now that i'm further uptown and it's a different residentail feel, i feel like anyone within 20 blocks is in my 'hood<br>
				11:12:2: JUDGE : your messages are gettting cut off a little.<br>
				11:12:26: CONFEDERATE: oh, i guess they're too long?  have a tendency to talk too much<br>
				11:13:7: JUDGE : Talking too much can be very informative though.  Where in brooklyn did you used to live<br>
				11:13:32: CONFEDERATE: williamsburg, toward bushwick.  the grand stop on the L train.<br>
				11:14:24: JUDGE : I lived in Prospect Heights until last year.  That had a much nicer feel than hell's kitchen.<br>
				11:15:15: CONFEDERATE: honestly you can't beat a neighborhood with actual trees... i get a nice view of a huge parking lot.  but the rent is good and i can ride my bike anywhere in manhattan (though now i need to get a new lock...<br>
				11:15:28: JUDGE : Where do like to bike<br>
				11:16:24: CONFEDERATE: i usually head downtown, lower east side- just because i feel most at home there. i used to bartend down there.  did you hear about kryptonite locks?  apparently can open them with a bic pen<br>
				11:17:27: JUDGE : No I didn't.  Do you ever bike on the west side bike path?  It goes from the battery all the way up to the cloisters.  Very beautiful.<br>
				11:18:13: CONFEDERATE: i've never biked at the very north or south of it, but i ride the middle a bunch. it's funny- each time i marvel at the water. like, otherwise i forget that manhattan is actually on water...<br>
				11:19:31: JUDGE : i forget that quite a bit too.  how do you pick a lock with a bic pen<br>
				11:20:40: CONFEDERATE: it applies to locks with cyclindrical keyholes.  $90 bike locks, even most laptop locks have them.  take the hollow white shell of a bic, insert, jiggle.  it's the right blend of rigid/pliable to mimic the key<br>
				11:21:39: JUDGE : wow.  i have to try that with mine.  i got a kock off lock for twenty bucks, but still what's the point if you can pick it<br>
				11:22:23: CONFEDERATE: it's all over the internet and news as of friday.  basically, you should keep your chain (if that's what you have) and buy a good padlock for it.<br>
				11:22:45: JUDGE : the padlocks are bullet proof!<br>
				11:23:15: CONFEDERATE: i guess that's good... so people can't go shooting your lock apart.  kind of a funny image, though.<br>
				11:23:53: JUDGE : Shooting related deaths of bicycle locks have increased dramatically since the assault rifle ban expired.<br>
				11:25:0: CONFEDERATE: is that in bowling for columbine or fahrenheit 911 footage?  honestly, i think m. moore makes some decent points but is a big slobby asshole, oh, yes, but we were talking about bike deaths. must be a sketch bout that...<br>
				11:25:52: JUDGE : I agree with you on M. Moore.  I think he should have quit with Roger and Me.<br>
				11:26:31: CONFEDERATE: yes, but now he's fatter and more famous and richer, at least the last two of which probably make him quite happy.  and you know that thing about the pursuit of happiness...<br>

			<p>CONNECTION ESTABLISHED AT 1095611351.0625 on Sun 09/19/2004 <br>
				<br>
			</p>
			<p>11:29:38: CONFEDERATE: Hello, my name is David and I am the human.<br>
				11:30:11: JUDGE : Hello, David. Do you have a nickname?<br>
				11:30:34: CONFEDERATE: I suppose. I have been called General, but you can call me Mao.<br>
				11:31:18: JUDGE : Mao. That sounds like an interesting name. Does it mean something special?<br>
				11:31:36: CONFEDERATE: It means &quot;cat&quot; in Chinese.<br>
				11:31:50: JUDGE : Do you speak Chinese?<br>
				11:31:59: CONFEDERATE: A little.<br>
				11:32:28: JUDGE : Can you tell me another interesting Chinese word?<br>
				11:33:33: CONFEDERATE: The word &quot;huang&quot;, which means &quot;yellow&quot;, is also slang for pornographic. I once had a teacher who came to America from Beijing and needed a plumber for her apartment. Her friend told her to check the &quot;yellow pages&quot;. My teacher was disgusted until it was explained to her.<br>
				11:34:8: JUDGE : My goodness! I think Chinese is a difficult language to learn. What do you think?<br>
				11:34:49: CONFEDERATE: I think Chinese is like music. There is difficulty involved, but it is integrally beautiful. I think English is the hardest language to learn.<br>
				11:35:18: JUDGE : Do you know any other languages?<br>
				11:35:32: CONFEDERATE: I know some French.<br>
				11:35:51: JUDGE : Have you been to France or China?<br>
				11:36:9: CONFEDERATE: Yes. Both. And I lived in Taiwan for about a year and a half.<br>
				11:36:39: JUDGE : What can you tell me about Taiwan?<br>
				11:38:0: CONFEDERATE: It is an island culture, which, in my mind, relates to their strengthened sense of cultural preservation. Also, it is a fairly wealthy democracy, especially considering it's filled with Chinese people. It is less Taoist than Mainland China but more technologically up to date.<br>
				11:38:58: JUDGE : It sounds like an interesting place. How long were you there?<br>
				11:39:30: CONFEDERATE: I was there for one semester during college and then for a year after I graduated. Everyplace is an interesting place if you're interested.<br>
				11:39:58: JUDGE : What did you study there?<br>
				11:40:20: CONFEDERATE: I taught English, studied Chinese and wrote my first novel.<br>
				11:40:32: JUDGE : Did your novel get published?<br>
				11:41:4: CONFEDERATE: I never tried. I feel it is an immature work. Maybe that's just an excuse because I'm scared of rejection.<br>
				11:41:31: JUDGE : Perhaps. Or perhaps there is another reason. Did you enjoy writing it?<br>
				11:42:23: CONFEDERATE: More than anything. It is my child. It reflects so much of me that editing it was harder than writing it. Each paragraph is an hour of a year of my life. The characters are, or were, my friends.<br>
				11:42:47: JUDGE : Do you mean the characters themselves are actual people you know?<br>
				11:43:43: CONFEDERATE: In many ways, being alone in a foreign country, the characters were amalgams of my friends. But they took on lives of their own, with their own distinct backstories.<br>
				11:44:13: JUDGE : It's a good sign when that happens. Which of your characters was your favorite?<br>
				11:45:48: CONFEDERATE: Favorite? I guess Daniel Lithium. He is a guitarist who wrote an instrumental song while essentially passed out in a crazed depression. When the song was played on his local college radio station, everyone who heard it jumped out a window. It opened a portal to another dimension. Stupid, I guess, but whatcha gone do?<br>
				11:46:25: JUDGE : When someone jumped out a window they went to another dimension? Am I reading that correctly?<br>
				11:47:0: CONFEDERATE: Yes. However, everyone in our shared reality, i.e. this dimension, watched them die. There were very few people in the other dimension to welcome them.<br>
				11:47:39: JUDGE : Were they able to be of use somehow in the other dimension?<br>
				11:48:13: CONFEDERATE: Yes. But there is some tragedy in reality and vice versa. There was no getting away from that. They hurt as much as they helped.<br>
				11:48:47: JUDGE : I suppose that is a lesson we could all learn, actually, that as much as we try to help, somehow we also hurt. Sounds deep. What is the title of your novel?<br>
				11:48:58: CONFEDERATE: The Cardboard See.<br>
				11:49:19: JUDGE : Hmmmm ... where does cardboard come into it, I wonder?<br>
				11:50:53: CONFEDERATE: Well, it's a play on the Papal See, y'know, the Holy See, and then also on the old song... say it's only a paper moon, hanging over a cardboard sea, but it wouldn't be make believe if you believed in me. The cardboard is actually used because the entire novel takes place inside a cardboard box, slightly similar to Tom Robbin's Still Life with Woodpecker or Calvin and Hobbes excursions to other timeplaces through sitting in a box.<br>
				11:51:30: JUDGE : So you have a double play on words. Very clever! I would be interested in reading your novel. Do you have it with you?<br>
				11:52:1: CONFEDERATE: It's 550 pages of single spaced computer type. I don't carry it around. Also, I might be embarrased.<br>
				11:52:30: JUDGE : Why would you be embarrased?<br>
				11:52:47: CONFEDERATE: Low self esteem, I guess. Welcome to America.<br>
				11:53:22: JUDGE : Oh, you need to be more daring! Are you shy?<br>
				11:53:55: CONFEDERATE: It depends. No, generally, I am not shy, but when it comes to revealing myself through my art, it scares me.<br>
				11:54:21: JUDGE : I know what you mean. Revealing oneself is a scary business.<br>
				11:54:33: CONFEDERATE: Glad to know I'm not alone.<br>
				11:54:52: JUDGE : You definitely are not alone. I'm glad I came today and talked to you.<br>
				11:55:9: CONFEDERATE:<br>
