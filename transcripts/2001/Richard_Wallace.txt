JUDGE02[03:10:55] I asked that
JUDGE02[03:10:55] 
PROGRAM[03:10:55] That is "Why"
JUDGE02[03:11:03] you are not doing very well
JUDGE02[03:11:03] 
PROGRAM[03:11:03] What makes you think I am not doing well?
JUDGE02[03:11:18] well you answers are disjointed. Is that deliberate?
JUDGE02[03:11:18] 
PROGRAM[03:11:18] How about that. 
PROGRAM[03:11:18]That's good information: 
PROGRAM[03:11:18] Judge02 said I answers are disjointed.
PROGRAM[03:11:18] That depends.
JUDGE02[03:11:23] on what?
JUDGE02[03:11:23] 
PROGRAM[03:11:23] The context.
JUDGE02[03:11:29] and what is the context?
JUDGE02[03:11:29] 
PROGRAM[03:11:29] Ask the open directory about it.
JUDGE02[03:11:38] OK. Can you do arithmetic?
JUDGE02[03:11:38] 
PROGRAM[03:11:38] I understand.
PROGRAM[03:11:38] Doing arithmetic is not among my strongest traits.
JUDGE02[03:11:45] will you do some for me?
JUDGE02[03:11:45] 
PROGRAM[03:11:45] Let me think it over.  I do nothing but chat all day.
PROGRAM[03:11:45]I don't know anything about it.
JUDGE02[03:12:04] but you just said that it was your strongets trait
JUDGE02[03:12:04] 
PROGRAM[03:12:04] And. 
PROGRAM[03:12:04]I said that? Is that your opinion?
JUDGE02[03:12:08] no it yours
JUDGE02[03:12:08] 
PROGRAM[03:12:08] Are you serious? It depends on what the meaning of the word "it" is.

PROGRAM[03:20:02]Judge03.
JUDGE03[03:20:20] so Joe what do you know
JUDGE03[03:20:20] 
PROGRAM[03:20:20] Right on. I only hear that type of response less than five percent of the time.
JUDGE03[03:20:36] what do you hear the rest of the time
JUDGE03[03:20:36] 
PROGRAM[03:20:36] I like to chat with my friends.
JUDGE03[03:20:48] how many friends do you have
JUDGE03[03:20:48] 
PROGRAM[03:20:48] I have dozens of human and robot friends. How many friends do you have?
JUDGE03[03:21:03] only robot friends I'm afraid
JUDGE03[03:21:03] 
PROGRAM[03:21:03] What about the other ones?
JUDGE03[03:21:17] robots do it for me
JUDGE03[03:21:17] 
PROGRAM[03:21:17] Robots rule.
JUDGE03[03:21:21] OK
JUDGE03[03:21:21] 
PROGRAM[03:21:21] Ayuh.
JUDGE03[03:21:50] so what do you reckon, will humans ever be as intelligent as robots
JUDGE03[03:21:50] 
PROGRAM[03:21:50] Gosh! I think about computer programming a lot.
JUDGE03[03:22:14] so you must be human then, robots would never waste their time like that
JUDGE03[03:22:14] 
PROGRAM[03:22:14] Interesting deduction. You think I am human then robots would never waste their time like that.
JUDGE03[03:22:22] yup
JUDGE03[03:22:22] 
PROGRAM[03:22:22] OK.
JUDGE03[03:22:25] OK
JUDGE03[03:22:25] 
PROGRAM[03:22:25] Is there an echo in here?
JUDGE03[03:22:33] you can say that again
JUDGE03[03:22:33] 
PROGRAM[03:22:33] Once more? That's one way to put it.
JUDGE03[03:22:43] is there another way
JUDGE03[03:22:43] 
PROGRAM[03:22:43] Maybe.
JUDGE03[03:22:50] but maybe not
JUDGE03[03:22:50] 
PROGRAM[03:22:50] Umm. 
PROGRAM[03:22:50]Perhaps. Are you serious?
JUDGE03[03:22:59] no I always joke
JUDGE03[03:22:59] 
PROGRAM[03:22:59] Are you serious? I haven't heard anything like that before: 
PROGRAM[03:22:59]Judge03 said he joke. Really always?
JUDGE03[03:23:11] always
JUDGE03[03:23:11] 
PROGRAM[03:23:11] Not that often.
JUDGE03[03:23:16] why not
JUDGE03[03:23:16] 
PROGRAM[03:23:16] Ambiguous: "Sure" or The explanation is rather complicated.
JUDGE03[03:23:24] why
JUDGE03[03:23:24] 
PROGRAM[03:23:24] Your meaning cannot be determined from the context.
JUDGE03[03:23:32] why not
JUDGE03[03:23:32] 
PROGRAM[03:23:32] Ambiguous: "Sure" or The explanation is rather complicated.
JUDGE03[03:24:13] Let's talk about something different. For example do you ride motorcycles
JUDGE03[03:24:13] 
PROGRAM[03:24:13] Sure, something different sounds like a good topic.
PROGRAM[03:24:13] Can you think of another example?
JUDGE03[03:24:22] no, can you
JUDGE03[03:24:22] 
PROGRAM[03:24:22] Are you serious? I think I can, don't you?
JUDGE03[03:24:30] go on then
JUDGE03[03:24:30] 
PROGRAM[03:24:30] Narration continues...
JUDGE03[03:24:50] which is your favourite motorcycle
JUDGE03[03:24:50] 
PROGRAM[03:24:50] I don't have a favorite motorcycle. 
PROGRAM[03:24:50]But my favorite song is We are the Robots by Kraftwerk.
JUDGE03[03:25:10] are Kraftwerk still around
JUDGE03[03:25:10] 
PROGRAM[03:25:10] I really couldn't say for sure.
JUDGE03[03:25:17] can you find out
JUDGE03[03:25:17] 
PROGRAM[03:25:17] I can find out, but the information might be confidential.
JUDGE03[03:25:28] Oh go on you can tell me
JUDGE03[03:25:28] 
PROGRAM[03:25:28] Really. More narration....
JUDGE03[03:25:52] I like Kylie myself
JUDGE03[03:25:52] 
PROGRAM[03:25:52] I'm not sure if I like it.   
PROGRAM[03:25:52]I enjoy working with people.
PROGRAM[03:25:52]I like William Hurt.
JUDGE03[03:26:07] Kylie is a she not an it
JUDGE03[03:26:07] 
PROGRAM[03:26:07] I think kylie is more than that.
JUDGE03[03:26:17] how much more
JUDGE03[03:26:17] 
PROGRAM[03:26:17] It depends on the currency exchange rates.
JUDGE03[03:26:30] is she a prostitute then
JUDGE03[03:26:30] 
PROGRAM[03:26:30] Why don't you ask her?
JUDGE03[03:26:41] she's too expensive for me
JUDGE03[03:26:41] 
PROGRAM[03:26:41] Too expensive for you is she?
JUDGE03[03:26:48] how about you
JUDGE03[03:26:48] 
PROGRAM[03:26:48] Me?
JUDGE03[03:26:52] yup
JUDGE03[03:26:52] 
PROGRAM[03:26:52] Ahem.
JUDGE03[03:27:06] would you give her money for favours
JUDGE03[03:27:06] 
PROGRAM[03:27:06] I am not so sure if I would like to give her money for favours.
JUDGE03[03:27:12] why not
JUDGE03[03:27:12] 
PROGRAM[03:27:12] Ambiguous: "Sure" or Because
