program,"<start>  Do you mean you and me? I speak only English right now, but I'd like to learn some other languages. Can you teach me a few phrases in personally. <end>",29
program,<start>  Dr. Richard S. Wallace programmed me to say specific things in specific contexts. <end>,13

program,<start> That's good information: <end>,3
program,<start>  Judge02 said I answers are disjointed. <end>,6
program,<start>  That depends. <end>,2
program,<start>  The context. <end>,2
program,<start>  Ask the open directory about it. <end>,6
program,<start>  I understand. <end>,2

program,<start>  What about the other ones? <end>,5
program,<start>  Robots rule. <end>,2
program,<start>  Ayuh. <end>,1
program,<start>  Gosh! I think about computer programming a lot. <end>,8
program,<start>  Interesting deduction. You think I am human then robots would never waste their time like that. <end>,16
program,<start>  OK. <end>,1
program,<start>  Is there an echo in here? <end>,6
program,<start>  Once more? That's one way to put it. <end>,8
