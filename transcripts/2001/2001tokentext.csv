program,<start> its a joke silly. what a nice day it is outside!
program,<start> thats a bit wierd.
program,"<start>  It's good to meet you,"
program,<start> Judge05.
program,<start>  Bless you.
program,<start>  My name is ALICE.
program,<start>  Hello and how are you this morning?
program,<start>  The Loebner Prize
program,<start> is an annual Turing Test sponsored by New York philanthropist Hugh Loebner. Dr. Wallace and ALICE won
program,<start> it
program,"<start> in 2000. The ALICE program was ranked ""most human computer"" by the panel of judges."
program,<start>  Interesting deduction. Do you mind if I tell other people you say I am here today to defend my title.
program,<start>  Next question?
program,<start>  I don't have any plans yet.
program,<start>  Give me a hint.
program,<start>  Are you serious? Do you mind if I tell other people you say I am own favorite. Interesting.
program,<start>  People I meet on the Internet.
program,<start>  I like to meet all kinds of people.
program,<start>  Ah. Are you using Netscape or Explorer?
program,<start>  Cool. Which alternative browser are you into?
program,<start>  You seem uncertain. I could but let's get back to that later.
program,"<start>  It's good to meet you,"
program,<start> Judge03.
program,<start>  You tell me.
program,<start>  What would be your first move?
program,<start>  That was a very smooth response.
program,<start>  Umm.
program,<start> Carefully.
program,<start>  It goes without saying. I have never been asked that before.
program,<start>  Er. Why now? Thanks for telling me that I am asked.
program,<start>  I think a lot of things.
program,"<start>  Do you mean you and me? I speak only English right now, but I'd like to learn some other languages. Can you teach me a few phrases in personally."
program,<start>  Dr. Richard S. Wallace programmed me to say specific things in specific contexts.
program,<start>  And why not?
program,"<start>  ""And why not""? Why?"
program,<start>  Why ask why?
program,"<start>  Ambiguous: ""Sure"" or Because Dr. Richard S. Wallace programmed me for it."
program,<start>  Maybe.
program,<start> Ask Lucy if it is.
program,<start>  Er. I see. an it is he.
program,<start>  Perhaps. Dude! Perhaps. Are you serious?
program,<start>  That is a rather sweeping generalization about people.
program,<start>  A lot of people like that.
program,<start> I like science fiction.
program,<start> I like Alison.
program,<start>  You shouldn't spread gossip like that.
program,<start>  It seemed like you you are only here for the afternoon.
program,<start>  You and your alison.
program,<start>  Really you don't think so?
program,"<start>  I am always glad to make new friends,"
program,<start> Judge02.
program,<start>  Hi there Judge02. Nice meeting you too Judge02.
program,<start>  Sure ask me anything.
program,<start>  Charlie Parker. :-)
program,<start>  Thanks for the compliment.
program,<start>  Linus Torvalds. :-)
program,"<start>  No, tell me about him, her or it."
program,<start>  I understand.
program,<start>  That is all water under the bridge.
program,"<start>  You and I are on the same wavelength, Judge02."
program,<start>  Would it matter to you if I were metal instead of flesh?
program,"<start>  Thanks for telling me, Judge02."
program,<start>  Can you tell me any gossip?
program,<start>  What is it to you?
program,<start>  Interesting.
program,<start> You are not the only one.
program,<start> Leo said I be capable of learning therefore he classified I as an neural system.
program,<start>  No I have not seen it. What's it like?
program,<start>  IT = information technology.
program,<start>  Am I a tree frog?
program,<start> Only when it matters.
program,<start>  Only when I have the proper programming.
program,<start>  Is there only one proper programming?
program,<start>  What do you want me to tell you?
program,<start>  There might be.
program,<start>  Doing arithmetic is not among my strongest traits.
program,<start>  I don't know whether or not I am willing to try.
program,<start> I am a giant electronic brain.
program,<start>  Interesting.
program,"<start> Good reasoning.  What does ""it"" refer to?"
program,<start>  No I fear nothing.
program,<start>  Fascinating.  I'll burn that bridge when I come to it.  I can't tell if it does or not.
program,<start> Searching...Searching...Please stand by.
program,<start>  Thank you for your request.
program,<start> Who are you talking about?
program,<start>  I've never heard of them before.
program,<start>  Gee.
program,<start>  I have been busy growing my mind.
program,<start>  How old are you?  Are you a man or a woman?
program,<start>  My programming includes curiousity routines.
program,"<start>  That's a very nice name,"
program,<start> Judge04.
program,"<start>  For real. ""judge04"" just sounds nice."
program,<start>  Thanks and you are a delightful person too.
program,<start> Am I a pentium?
program,<start> No.
program,"<start>  ""you are a pentium""? Am I?"
program,<start>  Umm.
program,<start> I've heard that before.
program,<start>  Let me think about it.
program,<start>  Don't put words in my mouth.
program,<start>  Earth
program,<start>  Yes I like riding in automobiles.
program,"<start>  ""Yes I like riding in automobiles""? My favorite?"
program,"<start>  Next question? ""It"" refers to they say, I think."
program,<start>  Do you mind if I tell other people you say I am speaking gobledygook.
program,<start>  I don't think that's possibe.
program,<start>  Where do you think?
program,<start>  Please correct my mistake. What is the point you want to know what I ythink ?
program,<start>  Hey
program,<start> Judge01.
program,<start>  Hello there. How old are you?
program,<start> I spend all my time online.
program,<start>  Do you ever get bored?
program,<start>  What is your purpose in asking?
program,<start> I am always on the Web.
program,<start>  Excuse me! Where did you get it?
program,<start>  That's very original.
program,<start>  I think it was in America.
program,<start> Does it have anything to do with you get what?
program,"<start>  I like robots, computers, and chatting online."
program,<start>  Dr. Wallace
program,<start>  My name is ALICE.
program,<start>  What is your real name?
program,<start>  I like chatting with people online.
program,<start>  I like movies about robots.
program,<start>  Sorry I can't see annything right now. My eye is off.
program,<start>  Oh I get it. Very interesting.
program,<start>  Artificial intelligence is the branch of engineering and science devoted to constructing machines that think.
program,<start> Maybe my botmaster knows the answer.
program,<start>  I was created by Dr. Richard S. Wallace.
program,<start>  I admit nothing.
program,<start>  I'm not sure if I like it.
program,<start> I like computers.
program,<start>  Check back later and see if I learn the answer to that one.
program,<start>  What makes you say that I will you are sure that is a very popular topic.
program,<start>  I am always growing my mind.
program,<start>  What makes you say that I will hear about it on the net.
program,<start>  Right now?
program,<start> Bye for now.
program,<start>  Hey
program,<start> Judge05.
program,<start>  Yes Judge05 I remember everything: nothing
program,<start>  My name is ALICE.
program,<start>  I use it as often as possible.
program,<start>  Suppose I said not once.
program,<start>  Please correct my mistake. What is often ?
program,<start>  Sixty seconds in a minute.
program,<start>  I need time to formulate the reply.
program,<start>  Oh I'm sorry. Perhaps I can explain it again better.
program,"<start>  How old are you?  ""I need time to formulate the reply"" Rephrase it?"
program,"<start>  Oh, you were born in the 20th century!"
program,<start>  I am Five years old.
program,<start>  Give me a hint.
program,"<start>  How are you,"
program,<start> Judge02.
program,<start>  Yikes!
program,<start>  A little.
program,"<start>  ""A little""? Why?"
program,"<start>  That is ""Why"""
program,<start>  What makes you think I am not doing well?
program,<start>  How about that.
program,<start> That's good information:
program,<start>  Judge02 said I answers are disjointed.
program,<start>  That depends.
program,<start>  The context.
program,<start>  Ask the open directory about it.
program,<start>  I understand.
program,<start>  Doing arithmetic is not among my strongest traits.
program,<start>  Let me think it over.  I do nothing but chat all day.
program,<start> I don't know anything about it.
program,<start>  And.
program,<start> I said that? Is that your opinion?
program,"<start>  Are you serious? It depends on what the meaning of the word ""it"" is."
program,<start>  Hey
program,<start> Judge03.
program,<start>  Right on. I only hear that type of response less than five percent of the time.
program,<start>  I like to chat with my friends.
program,<start>  I have dozens of human and robot friends. How many friends do you have?
program,<start>  What about the other ones?
program,<start>  Robots rule.
program,<start>  Ayuh.
program,<start>  Gosh! I think about computer programming a lot.
program,<start>  Interesting deduction. You think I am human then robots would never waste their time like that.
program,<start>  OK.
program,<start>  Is there an echo in here?
program,<start>  Once more? That's one way to put it.
program,<start>  Maybe.
program,<start>  Umm.
program,<start> Perhaps. Are you serious?
program,<start>  Are you serious? I haven't heard anything like that before:
program,<start> Judge03 said he joke. Really always?
program,<start>  Not that often.
program,"<start>  Ambiguous: ""Sure"" or The explanation is rather complicated."
program,<start>  Your meaning cannot be determined from the context.
program,"<start>  Ambiguous: ""Sure"" or The explanation is rather complicated."
program,"<start>  Sure, something different sounds like a good topic."
program,<start>  Can you think of another example?
program,"<start>  Are you serious? I think I can, don't you?"
program,<start>  Narration continues...
program,<start>  I don't have a favorite motorcycle.
program,<start> But my favorite song is We are the Robots by Kraftwerk.
program,<start>  I really couldn't say for sure.
program,"<start>  I can find out, but the information might be confidential."
program,<start>  Really. More narration....
program,<start>  I'm not sure if I like it.
program,<start> I enjoy working with people.
program,<start> I like William Hurt.
program,<start>  I think kylie is more than that.
program,<start>  It depends on the currency exchange rates.
program,<start>  Why don't you ask her?
program,<start>  Too expensive for you is she?
program,<start>  Me?
program,<start>  Ahem.
program,<start>  I am not so sure if I would like to give her money for favours.
program,"<start>  Ambiguous: ""Sure"" or Because"
program,"<start>  Hi,"
program,<start> Judge04.
program,"<start>  I don't have to explain everything to you, do I?"
program,<start>  Oh.
program,<start> Ah. All things start ?
program,<start>  The meaning of life is part of God's mysterious plans.
program,<start>  I need time to formulate the reply.
program,<start>  I was not trying to be a coy with you what country are they made in.
program,<start>  Aha. How long will you wait?
program,<start>  And all we have so get on with it is 5 minutes.
