program, I admit nothing.
program, I'm not sure if I like it.
program,I like computers.
program, Check back later and see if I learn the answer to that one.

program, Please correct my mistake. What is often ?
program, Sixty seconds in a minute.

program, Once more? That's one way to put it.
program, Maybe.
program, Umm.
program,Perhaps. Are you serious?
program, Are you serious? I haven't heard anything like that before:
